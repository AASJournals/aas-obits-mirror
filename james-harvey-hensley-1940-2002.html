  <p>James Harvey Hensley, a dedicated educator in astronomy and physics for
  over thirty years, died in Platteville, Wisconsin on 13 March 2002. He had
  been suffering from cancer since the spring of 2001.</p>

  <p>Harvey, as he was known to his friends, was born on 15 May 1940 in
  Lexington, Kentucky. His father, Dr. William Allen Hensley was a chemist while
  his mother, Stella, was a registered nurse. Harvey earned his BS in physics
  from University of Missouri-Columbia in 1962 and an MS in physics from
  University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1967. He began teaching in the Physics
  Department at University of Wisconsin-Platteville in 1968, taking time off to
  earn a PhD in Science Education from the University of Iowa in 1974.</p>

  <p>Harvey began his career as a high school physics and math teacher in
  Raytown, Missouri from 1962 to 1965. After completing his MS he became an
  assistant professor of astronomy and physics at the University of
  Wisconsin-Platteville, retiring as a full professor in 2001. He served as
  department chair from 1980 to 1992. From 1981 until his retirement he was also
  an adjunct professor at Governor’s State University in University Park,
  Illinois, teaching weekend astronomy classes.</p>

  <p>For thirty-four years at UW-Platteville, Harvey was committed to physics
  and astronomy education. He was a member of the American Association of
  Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society
  of the Pacific, and the Astronomy Educators Association. He served on the AAS
  Education Advisory Board from 1989 to 1991 and was a member of the working
  group in astronomy education from 1990. Harvey was a member of the Wisconsin
  Society of Science Teachers and presented numerous workshops for elementary
  and high school teachers over the years. The past few years he was involved in
  research and course development in the calculus-based physics sequence,
  presenting the results of his work at both regional and national AAPT
  meetings.</p>

  <p>Although he taught both physics and astronomy during his years at
  UW-Platteville, Harvey’s first love was astronomy. Not only did he share his
  enthusiasm for astronomy with his students, but he also shared astronomy with
  seniors and children alike in Elderhostel and College for Kids, respectively.
  He was a frequent and favorite guest in the elementary and middle schools of
  the area, bringing both knowledge and entertainment to the classroom. He even
  took his love for astronomy to the airwaves, presenting a brief, weekly
  astronomy program on one of the local radio stations for a while.</p>

  <p>For many residents of Platteville, though, their memories of Harvey center
  on his public viewings. Anytime there was a partial or total eclipse of the
  Sun or Moon, he would set up telescopes in front of the science building and
  literally beg people to stop and take a look. In thirty plus years he reached
  a lot of people that way. One such viewing stands out in my mind. I was out of
  town, but I heard about it in an unexpected way. In the summer of 1989 there
  as a full lunar eclipse over Platteville. Harvey had his telescopes set up as
  usual. But that day there were members of the national media present covering
  the Chicago Bears who were in training camp on campus. One of the reporters
  filmed Harvey in action, sent in the tape and it was played on national news
  the next evening. When I stopped in at my brother’s house in Denver the next
  day, he informed me that he had seen UW-Platteville on national news. That’s
  Harvey!</p>

  <p>Harvey did have other interests besides astronomy. He served as faculty
  advisor for the Phi Eta Sigma honor society for about ten years, and in that
  role he developed very close ties with many of the students on campus. He was
  a long-term member of the local Optimist Club serving as president for two
  years. He and his wife Lila were active supporters of the arts in the area,
  particularly the Wisconsin Shakespeare Festival at the university. And Harvey
  had a very visible hobby—his Porsche. He spent many hours caring for his car
  and studying about Porsches in general. He was an active member and officer of
  the Madison Region of the Porsche Club of America, and his physics lectures
  and tests were sprinkled with Porsche examples. For over thirty years his
  office on campus was a shrine to his two loves—astronomy and the Porsche.</p>

  <p>Harvey is survived by his wife of thirty-nine years, Lila née Baur Hensley,
  their two children, David Allen Hensley and Melissa Ann Hensley.</p>
