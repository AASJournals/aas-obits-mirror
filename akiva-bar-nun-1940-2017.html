      <h1>Akiva Bar-Nun (1940-2017)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Akiva Bar-Nun, a leader in the field of cosmochemistry, died in Jerusalem,
  Israel on January 25, 2017, after a long illness. Akiva was born in 1940.
  After completing his doctorate in shock wave chemistry at the Hebrew
  University in Jerusalem in 1968, he did his postdoc at Cornell University,
  where he worked with the late Carl Sagan. This led to a lifelong interest in
  the origins of life.</p>

  <p>His formal entrance into the field of planetary science came with a 1975
  paper predicting that thunderstorm shocks were the source of short-lived
  hydrocarbons in Jupiter's atmosphere. This prediction was eventually confirmed
  by spacecraft observations. In 1976, after six years as lecturer at the Hebrew
  University, Akiva joined the faculty at Tel Aviv University. There he
  continued to explore the importance of shockwaves for the origins of life. In
  addition, he investigated the photochemical production of planetary aerosols.
  Later on, he set up his unique and world-famous laboratory, where he conducted
  pioneering studies of ices under conditions typical of comets. His
  investigations on trapping of volatiles by cometary ices and their subsequent
  release upon warming of the ice, revolutionized cometary research. Akiva's
  expertise made him a valuable contributor to several international space
  projects, including the HASI experiment on the HUYGENS spacecraft that landed
  on Titan, as well as the ALICE and ROSINA instruments on the ROSETTA
  spacecraft.</p>

  <p>Akiva served as the Director General of the Israel Space Agency between
  1989-1993, and then for another two years as its Vice Chairman. He was an
  excellent teacher and mentor, who inspired numerous students, and he played an
  important role in advancing the public understanding of science. Generations
  of young students have delighted in his book on the Solar System (New Worlds,
  published in 1984, in Hebrew).</p>

  <p>Akiva was also a good friend. He will be sorely missed.</p>
