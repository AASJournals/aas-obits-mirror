  <p>Leonida Rosino, Professor emeritus of Astronomy at the University of Padua
  and former Director, for 30 years, of the Padova and Asiago Observatories,
  died in Padova on July 31, 1997, at the age of 81. Born in Treviso (Italy) on
  September 19, 1915, Rosino receive his degree in physics at the University of
  Padova. His advisor was Bruno Rossi, then Director of the Padova Physics
  Institute.</p>

  <p>He then spent the first 15 years of his career at the University of Bologna
  before moving back to Padova.</p>

  <p>He was scientifically active until his last days, when he transmitted to
  Asiago his observing program to be carried out with the Schmidt telescopes.
  Rosino will be remembered both for his scientific research and for the role he
  had in promoting Italian astronomy. Rosino's scientific activity was mainly
  devoted to variable stars. He started, just two years before World War II, a
  systematic study of RR Lyrae stars in globular clusters, carried out for more
  than two decades. The results are summarized in a classical paper published in
  1975 in
    <cite>
      Vistas in Astronomy,</cite> where all the data then available on the
      cluster variables are summarized and the distances to the clusters are
      derived, so that a remarkable galactic map is constructed.</p>
  <p>The cataclysmic variables, particularly those of the U Geminorum type, were
  also the subject of several of his investigations. When Rosino came to Asiago,
  he devoted himself to the explosive phases of novae, studying almost 20 novae
  both photometrically and spectroscopically, and describing their behavior from
  the outburst phase down to the quiescent stage. More recently, he and his
  colleagues carried out a quantitative study of the physical properties of the
  ejected material. Novae in M31 and M33 were also surveyed by Rosino for many
  years, demonstrating the dependence of nova rates on the morphological type of
  the parent galaxy. He also examined light curves of novae in Andromeda and
  calibrated the relation between apparent magnitude at maximum and the rate of
  decline. The supernova search carried out for more than 20 years at Asiago by
  Rosino gave worldwide reknown to the Observatory.</p>

  <p>More than 30 supernovae were discovered and followed up photometrically and
  spectroscopically. Another key paper by Rosino and his collaborators, "On the
  Light Curves and Properties of Type I Supernovae," published in 1973, was
  based on these data. Leonida Rosino and his colleagues and close friends,
  Gugliemo Righini and Livio Gratton, changed the focus of Italian astronomy by
  introducing astrophysical research. Much of Rosino' s effort went into the
  development of Asiago Observatory including the 40-50 cm and 65-90 cm Schmidt
  telescopes and the 182 cm reflector, in 1958, 1967, and 1973,
  respectively.</p>

  <p>With these plus the original 122 cm reflector, Asiago became the center of
  Italian observational astronomy, with the facilities used by astronomers not
  only from Italy but from all over the world down to the present. Rosino gave a
  strong impulse to the organization of astronomical studies in Padova. This
  University and that in Bologna are the only two institutions in Italy that
  offer a full curriculum, from undergraduate to graduate studies, in astronomy.
  Just before his death, Rosino had the opportunity to see realized one of the
  dreams of his life, with the opening of the Italian National Telescope, of
  which he had been the chief promoter, in the Canary Islands. Leonida Rosino
  was honored by the Prize of the Italian Ministry of Education, and he received
  honorary degrees from the Universities of Basel and Innsbruck.</p>
