  <p>James H. "Trex" Trexler, Naval Center for Space Technology, a retired
  scientist and astronomer, with a 50-year career at NRL died of cancer on
  October 22, 2005, at the age of 87.</p>

  <p>Born in Missoula, Montana (May 18, 1918), he grew up in Dallas, Texas, and
  attended Southern Methodist University (SMU) Engineering School. He combined
  his interests in astronomy and radio communication and operated the
  observatory on the SMU campus. Mr. Trexler had a most interesting and
  rewarding career at NRL, which resulted in notable contributions in scientific
  and technical developments.</p>

  <p>While at SMU, he worked on a government-sponsored project on radio
  detection and tracking of meteors. This work resulted in a call from NRL in
  1942 to join the Navy radio detection effort being mounted against the German
  submarine Wolf Packs that were harassing our North Atlantic convoys on the
  supply routes to our European Allies. The program proved highly successful
  causing the breakup of the German Pack operation, and resulted in the sinking
  and capturing of many U-boats.</p>

  <p>After World War II, Trex and H. O. Lorenzen brought the German Navy's very
  advanced Wullenweber Direction Finder back to NRL, and rebuilt it at the
  Washington Coast Guard Station, south of Alexandria. It served as the
  prototype for the Direction Finder at the heart of the Navy and Air Force
  intercept networks and later as the first tracker of the Soviet Sputnik. He
  received the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his efforts.</p>

  <p>In the late l940s, Trex built the radar intercept equipment for the Navy's
  P4M Airborne Cold War Ferret Program. This capability provided instantaneous
  frequency and direction of arrival against Soviet radars from high-altitude
  flights along the Soviet borders.</p>

  <p>His Radio Physics Branch developed a surface mobile intercept system
  deployed to the Near East for which the Navy made the first group cash
  incentive award. With the beginning of the space age, his branch examined the
  moon as a possible passive radio relay satellite. Intercept of foreign radars
  was achieved in 1948, and this led to the large Stump Neck, Maryland Moon
  Propagation Facility, where voice transmission over the moon circuit was
  achieved in 1951.</p>

  <p>Trex received the Navy's Distinguished Civilian Service Award for his
  intercept work at Stump Neck and the Chesapeake Bay Annex. An immediate
  outgrowth was the Navy's communication Moon Relay (CMR) system that provided
  our Navy with satellite communication a decade before the artificial
  satellites were operational. A demonstration of Doppler navigation using the
  moon as a navigation satellite was also carried out at this time.</p>

  <p>The intercept aspects of the moon technology were pursued at the NRL Sugar
  Grove, West Virginia, facility from 1958 through 1986. Sugar Grove is now
  operated by the Navy as a first-class space radio facility. After his
  retirement, May 1, 1990, Trex continued his space interests. In 1997, he and
  his wife Fran took a special trip to the Fred Whipple Smithsonian Observatory
  area, Arizona, to capture some exciting photographs of the Hale-Bopp
  comet.</p>

  <p>Trex served as president of the National Capital Astronomers Club in
  Washington, DC. Also, he was a member of the Tucson Amateur Astronomical
  Association, and the Sonora Astronomical Society of Green Valley. He served as
  a volunteer tour guide for the Smithsonian Whipple Observatory, the University
  of Arizona Mirror Lab and on the board of the Green Valley Community Church
  Foundation, an organization that awards college scholarships for general
  education to young people in southern Arizona.</p>
