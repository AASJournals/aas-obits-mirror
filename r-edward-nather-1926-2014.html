  <p><em>The memorial essay below, part of a General Faculty resolution at the
  University of Texas at Austin in memory of Ed Nather, is reprinted here with
  permission of the authors.</em>
  </p>

  <p>R. Edward Nather was the Rex G. Baker, Jr. and McDonald Observatory
  Centennial research professor emeritus of astronomy. As his daughter, Lara,
  put it in an email she wrote on 13 August 2014, “Dad passed away this morning
  ... and he is now with his stars.” He is survived by his wife of over fifty
  years, Marilane Nather; their children, Wendy Nather, David Nather, and Lara
  Nather; his children Kathy Nather Thomas and Kelley Thompson from a previous
  marriage; nine grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren. Ed is many things.
  He is husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, colleague, mentor, and
  friend. Ed is an iconoclast; he is also a carefully cultivated, self-described
  curmudgeon who does not suffer fools gladly. We stubbornly insist on using the
  present tense throughout. Why will become clear.</p>

  <p>Ed is funny and brutally honesty. He is brilliant. He is a genius, but to
  call him a mere genius is a disservice. He is more; he is a polymath. Unlike
  many so labeled, he is not a “jack-of- all trades, master of none,” rather Ed
  is a master of many—not a dabbler, but a doer.</p>

  <p>Ed often points out that the most powerful form of communication is a
  story. Even a scientific paper should tell a story; we remember stories best.
  We will tell not “The Story of Mel,” but the “Story of Ed,” to steal from one
  of his well-known writings.</p>

  <p>Ed’s parents, Frederick Bucklin Nather and Florence K. Skillman, along with
  his older brother, Frederick, welcomed him into the world on 23 September
  1926, in Helena, Montana. To say that Ed’s career path was unusual is an
  understatement. His eventual career path started as a child in his family
  home, where he built his first crystal radio set. He claims that dealing with
  circuits he could see gave him a tremendous edge later with micro-electronics
  and solid-state circuits: Ed could visualize the invisible.</p>

  <p>During World War II, Ed graduated early from high school to join the Navy.
  There he served as an electronic technician’s mate. In the United States Navy,
  he first adopted what became a research group operating principle when he
  built a radar-jamming device and tested it in-flight. Upon landing, he was met
  by military police. The principle: it is easier to get forgiveness than
  permission. Words to live by.</p>

  <p>Following the war, he earned his undergraduate degree in English, at
  Whitman College. Next, as described in the obituary written by his family, “He
  then commenced his lifelong practice of following his interests and then
  getting paid for them.”</p>

  <p>His extraordinary and seemingly crazy path took him from the Hanford Atomic
  Works and nuclear physics to writing science fiction for General Atomics,
  Sharp Laboratories, computer programming—writing one of the first FORTRAN
  compilers, becoming a pioneering hacker—actually writing the first computer
  virus, to innovations in medical instruments, and finally to his great
  scientific love, astronomy.</p>

  <p>In 1968, Ed came to The University of Texas at Austin as an electronics
  engineer. Here he revolutionized computer control of telescopes and
  instruments, initially using Data General Nova Computer, Serial Number 1. He
  founded, with Brian Warner and David Evans, the field of high-speed photometry
  for measuring stellar radii through observations of lunar occultations and
  studying variable stars. The University insisted that Ed needed a graduate
  degree to serve on the faculty, so he went to South Africa and obtained a
  Ph.D. in short order. His adventures in South Africa complete, Ed served as
  director of Wise Observatory in Israel before returning to UT Austin to join
  the faculty as professor of astronomy.</p>

  <p>His next innovation was the two-channel photometer. This created another
  revolution by allowing astronomers to distinguish variations in the sky,
  changes in transparency, or cloud from physical variations in the star.</p>

  <p>His innovative work was publicly recognized. He was awarded the Boyden
  Premium from the Franklin Institute in 1980, later he was named the Rex G.
  Baker, Jr. and McDonald Observatory Centennial Research Professorship. He won
  the Muhlmann Award for the development of the Whole Earth Telescope. He was a
  member of the International Astronomical Union, but never joined the American
  Astronomical Society—in spite of much pleading on their part—because of their
  insistence on a Ph.D. for full membership. Ed wasn’t done with innovation. In
  2001, he developed—with graduate student Anjum Mukadam—the Argos CCD
  time-series photometer. This instrument resurrected the oldest telescope at
  McDonald Observatory, the seventy-five-year-old Otto Struve Telescope, from
  being mothballed and transformed it into a cutting-edge machine for
  time-series photometry. The Argos System was used for the discovery of several
  new classes of objects. This includes two new classes of white dwarf
  variables, the DQVs and ELMVs, as well as a double eclipsing binary star with
  a 12.7- minute orbital period. It is the “loudest” non-interacting source of
  gravitational radiation known. It has produced several Ph.D. theses and will,
  no doubt, continue to produce more.</p>

  <p>His instruments are always science driven. They do one thing and they do
  that one thing extremely well; an important life-lesson. They brought whole
  new fields into existence. As Jim Liebert likes to point out, Ed’s group
  specializes in discovery. After inventing a new field, many others would
  simply begin to work in it. Ed would say, “I hear the thundering hoofbeats,
  time to move on.” We always do.</p>

  <p>Ed’s major legacy to The University of Texas at Austin, surprisingly, is
  neither his instruments nor the science done with them. It is his students. He
  supervised, or co-supervised, more than twenty Ph.D.s in astronomy. Most of
  these graduate students went on to illustrious careers in science. In addition
  to the graduate students, he also cherished his undergraduate students. During
  his four decades as a professor at UT Austin, he developed and taught two
  unique undergraduate courses: Astronomy in Science Fiction and Astronomy
  Bizarre. He stirred the imaginations of the non-science and engineering majors
  he taught and transformed forever the minds of many of those who took his
  courses. Many of these went on to be successful in fields other than science.
  Some of these took the time to contact Ed, sometimes decades later, to thank
  him for how he taught them to think.</p>

  <p>Now it should be clear why we insist on using the present tense. This is
  because Ed is, above all things, a teacher. He likes to say that the most
  important thing we have to teach is, “how we think of things.” He transformed
  each one of us: family, friends, colleagues, and students. We all think of
  things differently as a result, a part of Ed has become a part of us,
  transformed us. As long as we are here, he is here. As long as we teach, he
  teaches. This is his growing legacy.</p>
