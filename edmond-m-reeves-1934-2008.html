<div>
  <p>With great sadness we report that Edmond (Ed) M. Reeves, a former leader of
  solar space research projects at Harvard College Observatory [HCO] and the
  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics [CfA], died on 8 August 2008, in
  Arlington, Virginia, after a long and heroic struggle with cancer.</p>

  <p>Ed was born in London, Ontario, Canada, on 14 January 1934. During his
  undergraduate and graduate years at the University of Western Ontario [UWO],
  he was in the Royal Canadian Navy (Reserve) as a Cadet (1952-1956), then as
  Instructing Officer, HMCS Prevost (1956-1959), and Lieutenant, Royal Canadian
  Navy (Reserve) retired. He received a Ph.D. in 1959 from the UWO, specializing
  in atomic and molecular physics. After two years of postdoctoral research in
  ultraviolet atomic spectroscopy at the Department of Physics, Imperial
  College, London, England, Ed joined the HCO Solar Satellite project, working
  with Leo Goldberg, Director of HCO, and pioneer in solar spectroscopy.</p>

  <p>In 1968, Ed was appointed Senior Research Associate at HCO, and in 1973 he
  received a joint appointment as Physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
  Observatory [SAO] when the CfA was initiated under George Field. During his
  seventeen years at the Observatory, Ed led a large and vibrant group of
  engineers and scientists in the Solar Satellite Project, developing a series
  of space missions to explore the extreme ultraviolet emission from the
  Sun.</p>

  <p>Ed also maintained his interest and research in laboratory atomic and
  molecular astrophysics and enjoyed a vigorous involvement in the HCO Shock
  Tube Laboratory. In the early 1960s, in the area of molecular spectroscopy, Ed
  and Bill Parkinson photographed the vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectrum of
  CO (the Fourth Positive system), which was produced at high temperature in a
  shock tube. This laboratory spectrum shortly led to the discovery of CO as an
  important source of opacity in the solar ultraviolet. Goldberg, who first
  identified CO vibration-rotation bands in the infrared solar spectrum in 1951,
  recognized at around 180 nm the prominent CO features in the shock tube
  spectra and in the solar spectra. The identification was confirmed by
  comparing the high-temperature laboratory spectra with published solar spectra
  taken by the Naval Research Laboratory with a rocket-borne spectrograph.</p>

  <p>Ed's work for the Solar Satellite Project included planning and carrying
  out laboratory, Vacuum UV absolute-intensity calibrations of the early rocket
  and satellite spectrometers. He set the requirement that the solar
  spectroscopic instruments have radiometric calibrations in the Vacuum UV,
  traceable to a laboratory standard.</p>

  <p>The space missions began with rocket experiments in the early 1960s,
  progressed to the Orbiting Solar Observatory [OSO] program in the mid-1960s,
  and culminated in the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectroheliometer on the Apollo
  Telescope Mount [ATM] of the Skylab missions in 1973 and 1974. Ed received
  NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1974. This sequence of
  space instruments laid much of the early groundwork for our current
  understanding of the outer solar atmosphere. For example, the OSO observations
  revealed for the first time coronal "holes," which we now know are the seat of
  the fast solar wind.</p>

  <p>Another experiment of particular interest and importance to solar physics
  resulted from the launch of a rocket-borne objective grating spectrograph into
  the path of totality of a solar eclipse from Wallops Island, Virginia, on 7
  March 1970. This lucky "rocket group" included Ralph Nicholls from York
  University, Canada; Reg Garton and Bob Speer from Imperial College, London;
  Bob Wilson, then from Culham in the UK; and, of course, Leo Goldberg and
  colleagues from HCO, a group made up of mentors, advisors, teachers, and
  friends of Ed's. The eclipse spectrogram revealed strong emission from neutral
  hydrogen (Lyman-alpha) in the solar corona. The discovery of the Lyman-alpha
  corona inspired the project for a Lyman-alpha coronagraph. At a Retirement
  Symposium dedicated to Ralph Nicholls in 1992, Ed recalled that at a coffee
  break about twenty years earlier, during the Skylab program at Houston, he,
  Bob Noyes, and Bob MacQueen outlined the need to develop a rocket-borne
  coronagraph to observe the hydrogen Lyman-alpha corona. Later, after returning
  to the CfA, Ed, Bob Noyes, and Bill Parkinson planned a rocket-borne
  spectrograph to image the extended corona, expecting to use a circular
  occulter. John Kohl joined the fledgling coronagraph project, and he realized
  that a linear external occulter would be better and also would match a
  spectrometer slit. This project became the origin of the Lyman-Alpha
  Coronagraph series of rocket and Spacelab experiments under John Kohl's
  leadership, culminating in the still-operating Ultraviolet Coronagraph
  Spectrometer [UVCS] experiment on the SOHO spacecraft.</p>

  <p>In 1978, Ed joined the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado,
  where he was Head of Administration and Support before moving to NASA
  Headquarters in 1982. There he became Director of the Flight Systems Office in
  the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, with
  responsibility for integrated planning and science operations for research
  using the Spacelab, Spacehab, and Mir missions. He led the activities for the
  research requirements and planning for the International Space Station and
  served as the Space Station Senior Scientist, the Executive Secretary of the
  Space Station Utilization Advisory Subcommittee, and the Executive Secretary
  of the Space Station Utilization Board at NASA Headquarters He also served as
  NASA's representative to the international Users Operations Panel, which
  coordinates the utilization planning for the Station across the international
  partners. Ed retired from NASA in 1998.</p>

  <p>Ed was an outdoors man who enjoyed camping, canoeing, and cross-country
  skiing with his family. He is survived by his wife Vivian, son Dr. Geoffrey
  Reeves, daughter Laurie Webster, and three grandchildren. Ed's son Geoff is
  Group Leader for Space Science and Atmospheric Science at Los Alamos National
  Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico. A funeral service took place on Friday, 15
  August at The Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia.</p>
