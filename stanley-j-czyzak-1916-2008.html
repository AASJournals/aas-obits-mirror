      <h1>Stanley J. Czyzak (1916-2008)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Stanley J. Czyzak was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 21, 1916 to recent
  Polish immigrants John and Sophia (Jezierski) Czyzak. Attending Fenn College
  (now Cleveland State University), he received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering
  in 1935 and another B.S. in Civil Engineering a year later. He worked as a
  chemical engineer and metallurgist in industry from 1935 to 1940, collecting
  an M.S. degree from John Carroll University in 1939. Joining the U.S. Army as
  a Second Lieutenant in January 1941, he flew combat missions in Southeast Asia
  in the US Army Air Force. He retired from active duty in July 1949 with a rank
  of Lieutenant Colonel, although he continued his collaboration with the Air
  Force. He received his D. Sc. degree in Physics and Mathematics from the
  University of Cincinnati in 1948. He was the Stephen H. Wilder Research Fellow
  at the University of Cincinnati from 1946 to 1948, a Research Physicist at the
  Argonne National Laboratory in 1948 and 1949, and a Research Physicist at the
  Battelle Memorial Institute from 1949 to 1950. After a year as an Assistant
  Professor of Physics at the University of Detroit (now the University of
  Detroit Mercy), he moved to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio,
  to serve as Chief of the Modern Physics Section of the Flight Research
  Laboratory during the Korean War, rising to the rank of Colonel. He returned
  to the University of Detroit as Professor and Vice-Chairman of the Physics
  Department from 1955 to 1960. He then returned to Wright-Patterson as
  Commander of the Air Force Institute of Technology from 1960 to 1966, being
  promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. Czyzak returned to academia in 1966
  when he joined the Department of Astronomy at the Ohio State University as
  Professor. He supervised five Ph. D. students there before becoming Professor
  Emeritus in June, 1983.</p>

  <p>Czyzak’s research covered a wide range of topics. Early publications
  were mostly on the study of crystals, for which he received two U. S. patents.
  He also studied such diverse topics as age-hardening of metals and diffraction
  of neutrons. By the early 1960s, his research began concentrating on atomic
  structure calculations, mostly using the Hartree-Fock method, which he and his
  co-authors applied to the solar corona and especially planetary nebulae. He
  had 95 refereed publications along with numerous technical reports for the
  Army and Air Force and chapters for several books. Nearly all his publications
  were with co-authors, especially L. H. Aller (with whom he had many observing
  runs), J. B. Kaler, and T. K. Krueger. Czyzak also combined his early work on
  the solid state with his astrophysical research to study interstellar grains.
  He was a member of IAU Commissions 14 (Atomic &amp; Molecular Data) and 34
  (Interstellar Matter).</p>

  <p>Czyzak died in the Summerville at Fox Run retirement home in Fairborn, Ohio
  on June 10, 2008. He was predeceased by his wife, Ruth, and two brothers. He
  is survived by his four children, Stanley, Patricia C. Mirenayat, James, and
  David.</p>
