  <p>Canadian astronomy lost it longest serving member with the death, on 21
  March 2002 at age 94, of Malcolm M. Thomson. Malcolm was born in Nelson,
  British Columbia, on 3 January 1908, the oldest of four children of a Baptist
  minister. Moving regularly as his father accepted periodic calls to serve new
  congregations, Thomson was educated in Edmonton and Winnipeg. He graduated in
  1929 from the University of Manitoba with a BA in mathematics. Thomson then
  joined the staff of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, where his primary
  concern was the development of accurate radio time signals for Canada. Under
  his supervision, time signals were broadcast on CHU in the short-wave band as
  well as the daily signals on the national radio service. With the exception of
  three years of wartime service with the Royal Canadian Air Force as a
  navigation instructor, and one year of educational leave during which he
  earned an MSc degree in astronomy at Yale University, Malcolm spent his entire
  career in the time service. Over those forty years, he guided improvements at
  the observatory as technology advanced from pendulum to crystal and then
  atomic clocks. In 1970, responsibility for time keeping was transferred, as
  part of optical astronomy, to the National Research Council of Canada where
  Malcolm was head of the Time and Frequency Section until his retirement in
  1972. His book, The Beginning of the Long Dash: A history of time keeping in
  Canada, was published in 1978. The title refers to the one o’clock official
  time signal still broadcast daily on FM radio.</p>

  <p>Malcolm Thomson was a most active participant in scientific and community
  activities. He served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada
  from 1966 to 1968 and on numerous national committees. Outside his
  professional duties, he was a leader in the programs of his church, service
  clubs, discussion groups and sports teams for youth. He participated in
  cross-country ski marathons until age eighty-five and enjoyed canoeing at the
  family cottage. He was also a ham-radio operator. His good health continued
  until only a few days before his death on the vernal equinox.</p>

  <p>An exceptionally large family of friends will remember Malcolm Thomson
  but will miss his cheerful smile. His wife of sixty-one years, Genevieve
  (née Mathieson), two sons, Morley and Fletcher, and four grandchildren
  survive him.</p>
