  <p>As director of the American Association of Variable Star Observers for
  thirty years, Janet Mattei led the organization through a series of major
  improvements and in the process, helped and influenced amateur and
  professional astronomers around the world. Having successfully tackled many
  challenges, however, Janet lost her battle with acute myelogenous leukemia on
  22 March 2004.</p>

  <p>One of five children of Bella and Baruk Akyüz, Janet was born on 2 January
  1943 in Bodrum, Turkey and received her pre-collegiate education there. She
  attended Brandeis University from 1962 until 1965 on a full Wein Scholarship,
  earning a BA in General Science. After eighteen months of supervising a
  cardiopulmonary laboratory, in 1967 she returned to Turkey to teach physics
  and mathematics in a high school, and then entered graduate school at Turkey's
  Ege University. Janet learned of the summer scholarships available at the
  Maria Mitchell Observatory on Nantucket, and applied to observatory director
  Dorrit Hoffleit for the opportunity to come back to the United States and
  learn about variable stars. That summer (1969) she learned to love variable
  stars, became acquainted with the AAVSO, and met her future husband, Michael
  Mattei. In 1970, after she earned her master's degree in astronomy at Ege
  University, Janet entered the University of Virginia where she earned a second
  master's degree in 1972 with a thesis on T Tauri stars. After receiving her
  degree in Virginia, Janet married Mike Mattei and became an assistant to
  Margaret Mayall at AAVSO headquarters.</p>

  <p>When Mayall decided to retire in 1973, the AAVSO Council asked Janet to
  assume the helm as director of the association. With such a sudden advance in
  her responsibilities, Janet had to rapidly learn the management side of
  running the organization as well as keep up with the day-to-day scientific
  activities - responding to requests for data, recording observations as
  pencil-points on paper charts, and predicting future maxima of long period
  variables. She accelerated a ten-year project to digitize all of AAVSO's
  archived as well as current data, without which a century of AAVSO
  observations would now be nearly inaccessible.</p>

  <p>In the mid-1970s professional interest in the cataclysmic variables began
  to ramp up. When she received the first requests for an AAVSO visual observing
  campaign coordinated with observations by orbiting observatories as well as
  large ground based telescopes, Janet accepted the invitation as both an
  opportunity and a challenge. AAVSO observers responded marvelously and,
  coupled with Janet's astute forecasting of when cataclysmic variables were
  likely to brighten again, the program emerged as one of the major technical
  successes of her tenure. Many AAVSO members will never forget their excitement
  when France Córdova came to our Fall meeting in 1978 to announce to the
  astronomical world that X-rays from SS Cyg had been detected by HEAO-1 on the
  first occasion after the satellite reached orbit when AAVSO observers reported
  that the star was brightening to a maximum. It was a moment of tremendous
  pride for everyone, most of all for Janet. It was a success that was repeated
  frequently in over six hundred subsequent coordinated observing runs with
  various satellites. This success greatly increased the impact of AAVSO on
  current astronomical research, enhanced its reputation, and also provided a
  more immediate thrill for the observers than the ongoing commitment to monitor
  slowly varying stars.</p>

  <p>The late 1970s and early 1980s were a period of substantial inflation in
  our nation's economy. Furthermore, staff turnover slowed progress with the
  data processing work, while observations coming to AAVSO from international
  variable star organizations and independent observers, especially from behind
  the iron curtain, were increasing rapidly. Faced with rising costs at the same
  time additional staff was needed to pursue the data processing problems, Janet
  reacted characteristically: she began taking night courses in management, data
  processing, fund raising, and other topics that could help her handle the
  AAVSO work load more efficiently. Nor was her formal education in astronomy
  quite complete, for during that difficult period she completed writing her
  dissertation and earned a PhD in astronomy from Ege University in 1982.</p>

  <p>AAVSO's headquarters on Concord Avenue was increasingly crowded and also
  insecure, as the historical data were stored in a building that was vulnerable
  to fire. In August 1985 long-term AAVSO secretary and benefactor Clinton
  Banker Ford (BAAS, 1994:1602) solved these problems by donating a new
  headquarters building at 25 Birch Street in Cambridge. Janet managed the move
  into the AAVSO's present facilities masterfully, and then led planning for a
  dedication of the building combined with a celebration of the AAVSO's
  seventy-fifth anniversary. It is a measure of Janet's growth in stature in the
  professional community that Ricardo Giacconi, then director of the Space
  Telescope Science Institute, was the keynote speaker for the celebration and
  it was attended by the leaders of variable star organizations from a number of
  countries. The meeting marked a major turning point in the affairs of AAVSO as
  well as in Janet's own outlook. Substantially more confident in her abilities
  as a manager and leader of the organization, Janet never looked back.</p>

  <p>Janet's international contacts, through her active participation in the
  International Astronomical Union (IAU), led her to participate in 1987 as one
  of the organizers of an IAU colloquium in Paris on the contribution of
  amateurs to astronomy, the first of her many later involvements in the field
  of professional-amateur (Pro-Am) cooperation. During that meeting, the
  Sociétié Astronomique de France (SAF) honored Janet with their Centennial
  Award for her leadership in variable star astronomy and within the AAVSO. She
  received an invitation from the Vereniging voor Sterrenkunde, the variable
  star observers in Belgium for AAVSO to hold its first European meeting in
  Brussels in July 1990. The meeting proved a huge success, and was followed in
  1997 by a second AAVSO European meeting in Sion, Switzerland and a Pan-Pacific
  meeting in 2003 in Hawaii. Through Janet's leadership, AAVSO reached out to
  the observers who were already supporting the association with their
  observations.</p>

  <p>One of Janet's strong interests was in education. Using a grant from the
  National Science Foundation, she led efforts to create Hands-On Astrophysics
  (HOA) based largely on variable stars and AAVSO data. Though it took several
  years to develop, HOA became the basis for a number of popular teacher
  workshops and is sure to lead many high school students into careers in
  science. Janet also helped many future professionals in astronomy, including
  Karen Meech and Peter Garnavich, and a few in other areas, by providing
  opportunities for them to work at headquarters during their studies or during
  an intermission in their formal schooling.</p>

  <p>Janet was active in, and honored by, other professional and amateur
  organizations. A member of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), she
  received the AAS's George van Biesbroeck award in 1993, served on the AAS
  Annenberg Award Committee (1994-1997) and served as the first chair of the AAS
  Professional Amateur Cooperation Committee. Also in 1993, the Astronomical
  League with their Leslie Peltier Award honored Janet for her leadership of the
  AAVSO and contributions to variable star astronomy. Janet was elected a
  director of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) and served six years
  in that capacity (1994-2000), co-chairing at least one Pro-Am workshop with
  the ASP. She was a member of three IAU Commissions over her thirty-five years
  of membership in that organization. In 1995, Janet was honored by the award of
  the Royal Astronomical Society's Jackson-Gwilt Medal and was the first
  recipient of the Giovanni Battista Lacchini Award for collaboration with
  amateur astronomers from Unione Astrofili Italiana. To honor her professional
  achievements, an asteroid was named for her (11695 Mattei). She always felt
  that these awards honored not just of her own work, but also the contributions
  of the members and observers who make up the AAVSO community.</p>

  <p>Janet Mattei left a very different AAVSO than the one she took over in
  1973. From 150,000 observations arriving annually and being handled on paper,
  now 500,000 arrive each year and are mostly processed and posted
  automatically. The association has a substantial endowment and owns its
  headquarters building in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The historical archive has
  been put into usable form, following two multi-year investments in
  digitization and validation. The activities of the AAVSO have been extended to
  include notifying space and ground observatories that particular objects are
  erupting and to capturing short-lived gamma ray burst afterglows. The
  organization's ties to those with similar missions around the world have been
  strengthened and, increasingly, the AAVSO's International Variable Star
  Database incorporates their data.</p>

  <p>Janet's final illness was followed, through email bulletins, by hundreds of
  her friends and colleagues around the world. Characteristically, during a
  remission-and-recovery time between treatments, Janet reached out by phone and
  email to many of her AAVSO associates and friends, and resumed her habit of
  sending appropriate cards for special occasions. The more than 200 email
  "memoriam" notes posted on the AAVSO web site after her death show that all
  who knew her, even if only briefly, considered her a friend, a mentor, or a
  fine example of a scientist and leader.</p>
