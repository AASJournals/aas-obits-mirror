  <p>Daniel Magnes Popper was born at Oakland, California on 17 August 1913 into
  an assimilated Jewish family that had already provided several California
  community leaders. He earned degrees at the University of California,
  Berkeley, an AB in 1934 and a PhD in 1938, defending a dissertation on
  Spectrophotometry of Nova Lacertae 1936, supervised by Arthur B. Wyse. The
  published version appeared in <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>, though Dan said
  many years later that he would have preferred publication in <em>Lick
  Observatory Bulletins</em>.</p>

  <p>Popper's early career was a peripatetic one, as he moved from a Martin
  Kellogg Fellowship at Eastman Kodak in Rochester, where he met his future wife
  (1938-39), to assistant astronomer and instructor positions at McDonald
  Observatory (where he was one of the founding staff members, 1939-42); on to
  an instructorship at Yerkes (1942-43), back to Berkeley to the Radiation
  Laboratory (Rad Lab) for war work (1943-45), then returning to Yerkes as
  instructor (1945-46) and assistant professor (1946-47). But, in 1947, he
  joined the new astronomy department at UCLA as its first stellar astronomer,
  and there he stayed, becoming full professor in 1955, chairing the department
  from 1951 to 1957 and 1959 to 1963, and retiring as professor emeritus and
  research astronomer in 1978.</p>

  <p>He was largely responsible for building the department from a service
  teaching one to a fully-recognized graduate program, recruiting Lawrence Aller
  and George Abell among other early members. He was a guest investigator at Mt.
  Wilson and Palomar Observatories from 1949 to 1978 and spent some sabbatical
  time at KPNO, but Lick was his first and last love, and he held the record for
  the longest observing career there in history, ending only months before his
  death on 9 September 1999.</p>

  <p>In addition to the AAS, Popper was a member of the Astronomical Society of
  the Pacific (from early in his graduate career) and of the International
  Astronomical Union, initially through Commission 29 (stellar spectra), but
  with a rapid, permanent transition to Commission 42 (close binary stars), on
  whose organizing committee he eventually served.</p>

  <p>He was the 1984 Karl Schwarzschild lecturer of the Astronomische
  Gesellschaft. One of Popper's few extended absences from UCLA was spent on an
  NSF Senior Research Fellowship at the Stellar Interferometry Program in
  Narrabri, NSW, Australia (1964-65), where he helped aim the program in the
  direction of establishing accurate stellar temperature scales. Popper's first
  paper, written with Lawrence Aller and Alfred Mikesell, dealt with the
  spectrum of DQ Her (Nova Herculis 1934). Both co-authors survive him, and
  indeed it must have been a healthy object to study, since other observers of
  the 1934 Nova who are still part of the community include Hermann Brück and
  Fred Whipple. Other early work included an orbit determination for a comet
  (1935d, van Biesbroeck; in those days at Lick every student had to do a comet
  orbit), consideration of the spectrum of Nova Lac 1936 (in which he correctly
  identified greatly-broadened lines of hydrogen and other common elements), and
  of SN 1937C (in which, he said, the lines were different from those of novae,
  though comparably broad, and not to be identified, a conclusion which stood
  for nearly 40 years). Together with Carl Seyfert (of the galaxies), Popper
  tackled in 1940-41 the problem of measuring the ratio of total to selective
  absorption in the interstellar medium, so that colors could be used directly
  to determine stellar distances. Their value was (allowing for the difference
  in color systems) essentially the modern one, A <em><sub>ν</sub></em> = 3
  <em>E</em> (<em>B –</em> <em>V</em>). The project, which continued until 1950,
  was aimed primarily at getting radial velocities and distances for B stars, to
  be used in galactic rotation studies. It included the first two spectrograms
  ever taken of HDE 226868 (the optical counterpart of the black hole X-ray
  binary, Cygnus X-I). Unfortunately, the two spectra were taken almost
  precisely 47 orbit periods apart, thus delaying the discovery of the system as
  a binary for some 30 years. An early determination of the gravitational
  redshift of 40 Eridani B is another Popper accomplishment relatively far
  afield from the territory we primarily associate with him. Dan Popper, almost
  uniquely in the modem astronomical community, was a "hedgehog," the kind of
  scientist who knows one big thing (while "foxes" know many small things). What
  he knew was how to determine orbits and masses of spectroscopic binaries, more
  and better than anybody else.</p>

  <p>Contrary to much astronomical custom, Popper attached, generously realistic
  error bars to his measurements, so that more recent redeterminations have
  confirmed his early results more precisely than could reasonably have been
  expected. Popper's first binary orbit appeared in 1942, his last in 1998, and
  just about every year in between, he published one or two papers with one to a
  few definitive orbits each. His observing career spanned the range from
  photographic emulsions to CCDs, and he pioneered the technique of exposing two
  orders of a grating spectrum simultaneously by juxtaposing two emulsions, so
  as to pick up H-alpha as well as the blue region at the same time, and he
  welcomed echelle spectrograms with enthusiasm as a result. Popper's focus
  moved slowly from the B stars of his youth to later spectral types, including
  many G and K stars in his retirement years. The last of these was HS Aqr, the
  radial velocity data for which he assembled in 1998-99, with colleagues in
  Copenhagen supplying the complementary light curves. A very large fraction of
  modern stellar astrophysics is built on the foundations of stellar masses as a
  function of spectral type measured by D.M. Popper.</p>

  <p>He also wrote the definitive review articles on the subject, though he
  admitted privately to being prouder of the individual orbits than of the
  collecting process.</p>

  <p>In 1969, he defined, on spectral criteria, the class of RS CVn stars
  (nearly equal masses, slightly evolved, and sporting emission lines), which
  later turned out to include many of the bright stellar sources of X-ray and
  radio emission. His intended prototype was AR Lac, rather than RS CVn, which
  was suggested by his student John Oliver. Popper had only one formal PhD
  student, John Oliver, now of the University of Florida, but served on many PhD
  committees, guided many research assistants who were employed on the binary
  orbit program, and influenced innumerable undergraduates through his
  introductory courses.</p>

  <p>At times, he lamented the difficulty of finding a younger astronomer
  willing to acquire the demanding skills needed to obtain accurate binary
  orbits. Johaness Andersen of Copenhagen became, in effect, Popper's virtual
  student, and studies of spectroscopic orbits do and will continue in his
  group. The people who shared memories of Dan Popper for this tribute used a
  remarkably diverse set of adjectives, ranging from gentle, kind, soft-spoken,
  reticent, supporting, low-key, encouraging, and helpful, thorough, modest,
  fair, accurate, conscientious, and openminded, to authoritative, fussy,
  uncompromising (particularly about careless work on binaries), and
  undeviatingly honest. He was the proverbial gentleman and scholar, who could
  criticize without crushing, but who also once faced off with a mountain lion
  and won. He held firm by scholarly standards, even outside astronomy.</p>

  <p>A graduate student who had sneaked through the UCLA language requirement by
  acquiring no more than a passing knowledge of French and German soon found
  himself assigned one paper in each to review for the department's journal
  club. No one would ever have supposed that Dan held the Pan American chair in
  astrophysical travel, but colleagues remembered pleasant and informative
  encounters in Moscow, Hamburg, Korea, Denmark, Argentina, Italy, Toronto, and
  many other places. The proceedings of IAU Colloquium 111, on fundamental
  stellar quantities (1984) were, very appropriately, dedicated to him. Given
  that Popper was both an extraordinarily private. and an extraordinarily nice
  person, it is perhaps not surprising that very few colleagues recounted what
  you might call "Popper stories." In fact, you have to go back to his graduate
  student days and a memory shared by Alfred Mikesell: I did see Dan Popper
  ruffled once. He had written a long term paper for Birge (head of the physics
  department), which was returned to him with no comment except a red ink circle
  around the word "absorption," as in absorption line. The word appeared many
  times in the paper and was encircled every time. Dan had spelled' it
  "absorbtion." Said Dan, "Well, at least he can see I'm consistent." He was too
  ruffled to recognize a compliment: Birge had read the whole thing! Dan's most
  famous avocation was hiking and climbing in the Sierra Nevadas, Alaska, and
  other wilderness locations. His participation in folk dancing with his first
  wife was less well known. Daniel Popper died on 9/9/99 (it was indeed an evil
  date) of bone cancer, the knowledge of which he shared with almost no one,
  only a few weeks after ceasing to come to the office regularly and to
  communicate electronically with colleagues. Jaunty, and very private, to the
  last, he claimed the cane he used briefly was mostly a fashion accessory.</p>

  <p>In 1940, Popper married Catherine Salo, who predeceased him. He is survived
  by his second wife, Elizabeth and a son Roger, of Guatemala. Contributors to
  this obituary include (alphabetically) Lawrence Aller, Johannes Andersen, Alan

  Mikesell, Don Morton, John Oliver, Jorge Sahade, Sumner Starrfield, Jocelyn
  Tomkin, and George Wallerstein. The complete texts of their remarks will be

  for Physics.</p>
