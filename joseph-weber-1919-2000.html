  <p>Joe Weber died on 30 September 2000 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during
  treatment for lymphoma that had been diagnosed about three years earlier.
  Joseph (Yonah ben Yakov) Weber was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on 17 May
  1919, the last of four children of Lithuanian-Gallitzianer immigrants Jacob
  and Lena Weber (the original family name of Gerber having been changed to
  match an available passport). The home language was Yiddish, but a street
  accident left him unable to talk, and the young Yonah's speech therapist was
  from Pennsylvania, leaving him with an accent that resulted in the family
  nickname Yankee. After school, weekend, and summer work, first as a paper
  carrier, then a golf caddy, and later in a radio store, persuaded him that
  mind work was more rewarding than muscle work, and he was a frequenter of the
  Danforth Memorial Library, claiming as an early favorite book Maxwell's
  <em>Relative and Absolute Motion</em> (though later favorites included
  <em>Madame Bovary</em> and <em>Lost Horizon</em>).</p>

  <p>Joe graduated from the local public schools and Paterson Talmud Torah
  (where he served as junior cantor until his voice changed at 16). After a year
  at Cooper Union in New York, he was old enough to take up an appointment at
  the US Naval Academy in Annapolis (won in a competitive exam) as part of the
  class of 1940. He stood first in his class in "thermodynamics, differential
  calculus, and other subjects of very little interest to the Navy," but nearly
  anchor in what is called "aptitude for the service" (meaning, roughly, social
  graces). He achieved recognition among his classmates for secretly wiring the
  mess hall for sound, so that one fine supper time, the sounds of Schubert's
  Great C Major Symphony suddenly drowned out voices and clanking dishes. As a
  rope climber on the gymnastics team, he was assigned to the weak squad, but
  could still make it to the top of a standard Olympic rope in his sixties.</p>

  <p>Upon commissioning as an ensign in the summer of 1940, Weber was assigned
  to the aircraft carrier <em>Lexington</em> under Captain Sherman, who put him
  to work on navigation, on the basis of his ability to solve spherical
  triangles. The <em>Lex</em> was the prime target at Pearl Harbor, but luckily
  had steamed out on the 5th of December 1941. She went down in the Battle of
  the Coral Sea (8 May 1942) while Lt. Weber was on watch; many shipmates below
  deck did not survive. Joe used part of the payment from the government for
  "articles lost in a marine disaster" to buy an engagement ring for his high
  school sweetheart, Anita Straus (BA in physics, Smith College 1939), whom he
  married later that year. She died in 1971.</p>

  <p>Soon after, he was given command of the submarine chase SC 690, which
  ferried convoys back and forth across the Atlantic and eventually was in the
  front wave of the Sicilian landing on 9 July 1943. One of Joe's favorite
  remarks was that, if they surfaced, the subs could actually go faster than the
  chasers, "but the submarines didn't know that," a useful guide to many
  activities.</p>

  <p>At the end of the war, Weber was assigned to wind down electronic
  countermeasures for the Navy, in the process of which he handed out what then
  seemed like sizable grants to various industrial and research organizations.
  Several of them offered him positions when he resigned his commission (leaving
  as Lt. Commander) in 1948, but he accepted instead a professorship at the
  University of Maryland. This was initially in electrical engineering. In fact,
  if you consider that Weber was a member of the Passaic County Amateur Radio
  Club from 1927 to 1936 and of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, later
  IEEE) from 1944 to his death, he was at least 13/16ths an engineer. A
  condition of the appointment was that he earn a PhD, somewhere, in something.
  Physics was his first choice, but when George Gamow responded, in preliminary
  conversation, that no, he, Gamow, did not know any good problems in microwave
  spectroscopy, Weber went on to Catholic University of America, receiving a PhD
  in 1951 for work with Keith Laidler on the inversion spectrum of ammonia. He
  remained at the University of Maryland, moving to the Physics Department in
  1961 and reluctantly accepting emeritus and senior researcher status in 1989.
  From 1973 onward, following his marriage to astronomer Virginia Trimble in
  1972, he spent half of each year at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

  <p>The work on measurement of microwave line intensities led to thoughts of
  amplifiers, and very soon after he first heard about the Einstein A and B
  coefficients, Weber realized that they provided a way to build a better one.
  He gave what seems to have been the first public talk (at the IRE meeting in
  Ottawa, Canada) in the summer of 1952 and published that same year the first
  open-literature paper on what is now called quantum electronics. His 1958
  fellowship citation from IRA IRE reads "for his early recognition of concepts
  leading to the maser," though others got bigger prizes for slightly later
  recognition of the concepts.</p>

  <p>Some reading in general relativity in the late 1950s (prompted by a child
  with poor sleep habits) led Weber to consider how one might make contact
  between that beautiful theory and laboratory measurements. His book,
  <em>General Relativity and Gravitational Radiation</em>, was published in
  1961, soon translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, and remains the
  thinnest volume on the topic. The first paper on how to build a gravity wave
  detector dates from 1966 and the first published data from 1969.</p>

  <p>His attitude was "build the best detector you know how to build, and
  operate it until you understand what you are seeing." His first antenna was an
  aluminum bar, and his postdoc, Robert L. Forward, built and operated the first
  free-mass interferometer in the early 1970s, soon after returning to Hughes
  Research Laboratories. The physics community did not endorse either the method
  or the results, and a large majority vote could easily be assembled for the
  position that "gravitational radiation exists, and Weber didn't discover it."
  But when SN 1987A went off, the only operating detectors (of dozens built up
  to that time) were Weber's and a near copy at the University of Rome (since
  turned off). Indeed the 36" room temperature bar is filling its last data tape
  even as this is being written, because, in recent years, Weber had suspected
  that there might be time coincidences between gamma ray bursts and pulses seen
  by the bars.</p>

  <p>Weber's final scientific thrust was an attempt to improve by a large factor
  the efficiency of neutrino detectors, using single near-perfect crystals of
  quartz or silicon in a coherent mode somewhat analogous to Mossbauer
  scattering of gamma rays. The main goal was to detect nuclear submarines from
  a distance, and a detector was operating in a test mode near the reactor of
  the National Institute of Standards and Technology until this year, though
  another design had also been used as a solar neutrino telescope.</p>

  <p>In addition to the AAS, he was a member of the International Astronomical
  Union, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the Italian Physical
  Society, and a fellow of the American Physical Society and the Institute of
  Electrical and Electronic Engineers. He held two Guggenheim Fellowships (1955,
  1962), a National Research Council Fellowship (1955), and a Fulbright
  Scholarship (1963) and was a visitor at the Lorentz Institute of Theoretical
  physics, Leiden (1955), the University of Colorado (1963), and the Institute
  for Advanced Study, Princeton (1956, 1962-1962, 1968-1969). Weber received
  awards from the Washington Academy of Sciences (Scientific Achievement Award,
  1958); the Gravity Research Foundation (First Prize in 1959 essay contest;
  Babson Award, 1970); Sigma Xi (1970); and the New York Academy of Sciences
  (Boris Pregel Prize 1973). He was elected to the Maryland Engineering Hall of
  Fame in 1988.</p>

  <p>Joe Weber is survived by his three siblings, three sons, six grandchildren,
  and Virginia Trimble, and was predeceased by his first wife and one son. He
  was, in the words of the Act of Congress under which graduates of Annapolis
  receive their commissions, "an officer and a gentleman."</p>
