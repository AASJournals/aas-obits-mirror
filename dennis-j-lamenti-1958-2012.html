  <p>Eulogy <br/>
    <em>(For Dennis Lamenti, written by Richard H. Durisen)</em><br/>
    <br/>
    I sing a song for this brave man, <br/>
    curious and kind, <br/>
    whose laughter burst from deep <br/>
    within his ample heart. <br/>
    Warrior of formulas and codes, <br/>
    he traced the mathematics <br/>
    of the stars, with wonder,<br/>
    through his ancestors’ eyes, <br/>
    And studied the tracks of science<br/>
    to divine his way anew <br/>
    along the sacred path, <br/>
    out of the common desert. <br/>
    Who could doubt the worthiness <br/>
    of this proud man? <br/>
    Who did not see those constellations <br/>
    twinkling in his eyes? <br/>
    Hair pulled back in a ponytail, <br/>
    “I am Diné,” he would say, <br/>
    And now the spirit of this wise man <br/>
    flies beyond the galaxies, <br/>
    speaking distant legends<br/>
    few of us will ever hear.<br/>
  </p>

  <p>Diné astronomer Dennis J.
  Lamenti began graduate studies in astronomy at Indiana University in 2006,
  after earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from San Francisco
  State University. Dennis was born in Flagstaff AZ to his parents Evelyn and
  Jimmy Lamenti, and his family emphasized the importance of education as a
  means to serve his people. He discovered his love for astronomy through his
  personal search for knowledge about the Holy People of the Diné, and began his
  formal studies of physics at Berkeley in 2002. He thirsted for knowledge and
  found inspiration in the connections among so many fields of physics and
  astronomy that come together to create our understanding of the Universe.</p>

  <p>In his sophomore year at Berkeley, Dennis’s experience with the Nearby
  Supernova Factory at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, developing
  algorithms to determine sky transparency in support of automated observations,
  drew him to astronomy. He worked for two summers with John Marriner at the
  Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
  Supernova Program. Dennis was responsible for programming the system to review
  supernova candidates visually using a web-based interface to the supernova
  database. His system was used unchanged for the duration of the survey.</p>

  <p>Graduate school opened another new world for Dennis, a world filled with
  excitement, challenges, reassessment, and new perspectives, through his
  interactions with faculty and fellow students. He came to appreciate the
  collaborative nature of astronomy and to value the strength of working
  together with others, rather than alone.</p>

  <p>During his graduate
  studies at Indiana University, Dennis received support from many sources,
  including research grants from the National Science Foundation, the Indiana
  University Graduate School, the Hollis and Greta Johnson endowment, Indiana
  Space Grant Consortium’s Graduate Fellowship program, the Midwest Crossroads
  Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate Fellowships, and
  departmental teaching assistantships. In 2009, Dennis successfully defended
  his Master’s research “Low-Amplitude Radial Velocity Studies in Praesepe,”
  working with Catherine Pilachowski, and received his Master’s Degree in
  Astronomy, sharing the joy of his accomplishment with his family and friends.
  As of Spring 2012, Dennis was completing his coursework for the Ph.D. and was
  planning to continue research on binary stars in clusters for his
  dissertation.</p>

  <p>Dennis loved to share his passion for Astronomy,
  especially to encourage Native American students to appreciate the connections
  between Diné culture and science, and to be aware of opportunities for Native
  American students in the sciences. While at IU, Dennis characteristically
  reached out to other Native American students and was extremely active in
  promoting academic success. He was among the three graduate students who,
  together, successfully founded IU’s First Nations Educational and Cultural
  Center. Dennis attended and contributed to meetings around the country to help
  broaden participation of Native American students in the sciences and to
  expand astronomy education. Some of these were sponsored the AAS, the
  Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the Society for the Advancement of
  Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, and the National Society of Black
  and Hispanic Physicists. Dennis served as chair of the Working Group on
  Cultural Astronomy and Storytelling for the American Astronomical Society for
  the International Year of Astronomy, to bring wider awareness of indigenous
  astronomy to the public. Dennis was a regular volunteer for departmental
  outreach efforts, including astronomy open houses, special public viewing
  opportunities, and visits to local schools. He was always eager to educate
  others about Diné culture and participated in many events throughout the state
  to promote understanding of Native cultures.</p>

  <p>Richard Durisen, who
  taught Dennis’ graduate stellar interiors class, fondly remembers going over
  arcane points of stellar physics with Dennis one-on-one, because it was such a
  joy to watch his face light up with genuine awe when he understood, for the
  first time, some intricate aspect of how the universe works. He usually
  expressed this with a broad grin, a chuckle, and an “Oh, wow!” Dennis was also
  a natural educator, who radiated his childlike and infectious delight in the
  wonders of astronomy to others. He loved teaching, and his students responded
  to his openness to ideas and his joy in learning about the world around him.
  He inspired his students with his love of knowledge.</p>

  <p>A particular
  goal for Dennis was to merge the worldview of modern astronomy with the spirit
  of Native American culture and to share this cosmic perspective with the
  Native American community. In his own words, “It was this magnificent beauty
  of the Universe that drew me in and to understand some part of it would be to
  understand the Diyin Diné (Holy People). So astronomy is a spiritual path for
  me.”</p>

  <p>No one who heard his laughter can ever forget its heartiness
  and warmth. He touched the lives of many, many people and will be sorely
  missed.</p>

  <p>His final days were spent peacefully with his family, with
  clear vision and acceptance. Dennis is survived by his parents, who now live
  in Concord, California, by sisters Denice Hill and Dawn Pywell, and by his
  nieces and nephews, all of whom he cherished. His spirit left this Earth with
  his family around him on one of his favorite holidays, Halloween. We are all
  comforted in the knowledge that Dennis will forever walk among the stars.</p>

  the IU Department of Astronomy, with contributions from Dennis’ family and
  friends.</em>
