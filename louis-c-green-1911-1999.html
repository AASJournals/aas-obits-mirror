  <p>Louis Green was born in Macon, Georgia in 1911 and joined the faculty of
  Haverford College in 1941. For over 50 years, as Professor of Astronomy and
  College administrator, he played a central role in the life of the College and
  of its faculty, and inspired generations of students. Louis died on April 10,
  1999.</p>

  <p>Both of Louis Green's degrees were from Princeton. His PhD was done under
  the supervision of Henry Norris Russell, but he worked most closely with Alan
  Shenstone. Indeed, Louis' scientific work was most clearly influenced by
  physicists, both at Princeton and by European colleagues working in quantum
  physics and spectroscopy.</p>

  <p>His first scientific publications were on spectroscopy, particularly the
  wavelengths and line strengths of heavy elements of astrophysical interest. He
  brought these research interests to Haverford, and carried out experiments in
  the basement of the Observatory through the 1940s. Later, Louis applied many
  of these findings to the spectra of stars, especially magnetic and peculiar A
  stars. Leading researchers and observatories provided him with high-resolution
  spectra which he and his students analyzed. In the 1960s and 1970s, his
  interests broadened to the internal structure of rapidly rotating and binary
  stars, and more generally to stellar evolution. Louis was quick to recognize
  the advantage of automatic computation to these studies and to those of other
  scientists at Haverford. In this connection, his long, collegial friendship
  with Martin Schwarzschild may have played a role. The mainframe computer he
  brought to Haverford in the 1960s replaced a brace of mechanical adding
  machines used to calculate stellar structures. The cranks of these machines
  were turned by Louis and an army of students and colleagues, many of them now
  productive scientists. An encouraging fraction of the young scientists
  introduced to research by Louis Green were women, women who now hold posts at
  a number of academic institutions and national observatories. Louis remained
  active, alert and interested in research right up to his last years. An
  elegant manuscript on mathematical astrophysics occupied his last decade, and
  even when wheelchair bound, he came to scientific talks at the College.</p>

  <p>Louis Green's contributions to the scientific literature were important,
  thorough and always extremely careful. His greatest contribution to our field,
  however, was that he inspired generations of young scientists, now scattered
  in scores of institutions in the U.S. and elsewhere. Louis was not only a
  stimulating lecturer, but his teaching extended well beyond the classroom. He
  directly involved his students in real research. In a casual conversation I
  had some 15 or 20 years ago with Joe Taylor, one of his former students, Joe
  remarked, "Louis Green must have trained more astronomers than any other
  person in the country." I suspect that may well be true. We too often forget
  that the first step in producing future scientists occurs in their
  undergraduate years. Louis took great, but quiet, pleasure in the scientific
  careers that started here and led to positions at Caltech, Harvard, NASA,
  Princeton, Texas and a host of other universities and observatories stretching
  from Germany to California. These men and women are Louis' heirs, and they and
  many others who knew him will miss his acute mind, his courtly kindness and
  his wry humor.</p>
