  <p><strong>Matthias Dietrich died on Thursday the 19<sup>th</sup> of July, 2018.</strong></p>

  <p>Matthias Dietrich passed away at the age of 56 after a long battle with
  cancer. He was born on 19 May 1962 and was raised in Eschwege, Germany. He
  obtained his Ph.D. at the Universität Göttingen in 1991 under Prof. K. J.
  Fricke with his dissertation “Zeitlich und spektral hochaufgelöste
  Variabilitätsanalyse von NGC 5548” (a temporally and spatially resolved
  variability analysis of NGC 5548), one of the first dissertations to make
  use of reverberation mapping. Matthias Dietrich held post-doctoral research
  positions at the Landessternwarte in Heidelberg, University of Florida,
  Georgia State University, and The Ohio State University. He had teaching
  positions at Ohio State and Ohio University. In 2014, he became an assistant
  professor at Worcester State University in Massachusetts. Matthias was a
  spectroscopist who studied quasars in the optical, ultraviolet, and near
  infrared. In addition to reverberation mapping, Matthias worked on AGN
  outflows, elemental abundances in quasars, and quasar black hole
  demographics. His work was of uniformly high quality and characterized by
  the great care with which he took and analyzed data. Anyone who worked with
  Matthias would acknowledge not only that he was an extremely skilled
  observer, in particular with vast experience on a variety of large
  facilities such as the LBT, but a very committed and enthusiastic scientist
  in general. Thus, reaching out to the public was second nature to him, and
  indeed teaching came easily to him – he was known for setting up his
  telescope in a public park and hosting spontaneous star parties. Amateur
  astronomers worldwide took delight in Matthias being present at many events
  providing expert help in observing and understanding celestial phenomena,
  with one highlight being the successful 2012 campaign to view the rare event
  of a transit of Venus. Countless students and colleagues in Columbus (OSU),
  Athens (Ohio University), and finally Massachusetts (Worcester State
  University) will remember him as extremely helpful, engaged, and friendly
  professor.</p>

  <p>A lifelong fan of German powerhouse FC Bayern München, Matthias also
  actively frustrated opponents on the soccer pitch in his favorite role as
  goalkeeper. His greatest achievement in sports, however, came very shortly
  after his first chemotherapy, when he successfully finished the Columbus
  Marathon. Enjoying nature and specifically living in harmony with the animal
  world (not only in the form of taking care of numerous pets, among them many
  faithful dogs, but extending definitely to the wilder fauna) were important
  focal points for Matthias. He actively engaged in many conservation
  projects, and his greatest joy came in realizing that the African orphan cow
  elephant he had adopted via a World Wildlife Fund project became (and still
  is) the respected matriarch of a large herd in the Serengeti.</p>

  <p>Matthias’ quiet optimism, his joyful nature, his friendliness, and above
  all his helpfulness will always be remembered. His fine sense of humor
  allowed him to master many a dire situation with irony rather than sarcasm
  or cynicism. It was this combination of characteristics that made Matthias a
  wonderful family man. He is survived by his wife Jennifer and beloved young
  daughter Katie.</p>
