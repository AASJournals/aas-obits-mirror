      <h1>Walter Orr Roberts (1915-1990)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Walter Orr Roberts was born in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts on August
  20, 1915, and died in Boulder, Colorado on March 12,1990, at age 74. In 1938
  he was graduated from Amherst College in western Massachusetts and that year
  entered graduate school at Harvard. In 1940 he married Janet Smock, who was to
  be his wife for 50 years. Immediately following their marriage he moved with
  her to the high mountains of Colorado where he worked to complete an
  observational thesis for a Harvard PhD involving solar activity and a
  coronagraph of the Lyot design which he had built and tested as a Harvard
  graduate student under the tutelage of Donald Menzel.</p>

  <p>The Robertses lived at Climax, near Leadville, for seven years, and there
  were born three of their four children: David, in 1943; Alan, in 1944; and
  Jennifer, in 1946. A fourth, Jonathan, was born in Boulder in 1951.</p>

  <p>In Climax was also born the High Altitude Observatory, which was
  established with administrative and support services in Boulder in 1947,
  replacing what had been, for seven years, a Coronagraph Station of the Harvard
  College Observatory. In 1960, when HAO had become a solar observatory of world
  renown, Roberts was asked to create and direct what was to become the National
  Center for Atmospheric Research, which he did, on the conditions that it would
  also be located in Boulder and that it would incorporate the High Altitude
  Observatory as a part of it.</p>

  <p>For 8 years, about the same period of time for which he had directed HAO,
  Roberts served as director of NCAR. For the ensuing 6 years he was the
  President of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, NCAR's
  parent organization. In 1973 he left UCAR to direct the Program on Food,
  Climate, and the World's Future for the Aspen Institute, for another 8 years.
  At that time he was 66, and had been working as a scientist and scientific
  administrator for 41 years. For the remaining nine years of his life, and to
  its very end, although ostensibly retired, he continued as a world leader in
  many activities, as President Emeritus of UCAR.</p>

  <p>Roberts was a founder of the Department of Astrogeophysics at the
  University of Colorado and took a personal research interest for many years in
  the study of influences of the Sun on weather and climate. He was also one of
  those who worked throughout the long years of East-West political tensions to
  maintain scientific contacts with many colleagues in the Soviet Union; he
  visited there often and through his scientific reputation in that country was
  to a degree responsible for the establishment of the Soviet coronagraph
  station at Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. In the later years of the Cold War he
  championed the use of direct electronic communications between individuals in
  the two countries, and led courses that bridged the two countries through
  computer communications.</p>

  <p>In his lifetime, Roberts received many honors, including 10 honorary
  doctorates — the first in 1958, when he was but 43, from Ripon College in
  Wisconsin, and the second, the following year, from Amherst. He was elected
  president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1968,
  when he was 53. He received many medals and prizes. The land on which the NCAR
  Mesa Laboratory now stands now bears the name "Roberts Mesa." A year before
  his death, in 1989, he was granted a medal from the United Nations Environment
  Programme, as perhaps the deepest and most encompassing tribute for a life of
  professional attainments in the interest of humankind.</p>

  <p>Although known to the world as a scientist, and an educator and humanist
  and philanthropist, Walter Orr Roberts was to those who knew him best a
  builder: first from the pieces of a partly-built coronagraph, then an
  observing station, and an observatory, and a collection of new staffs and new
  buildings, and new institutions, each better than the one before.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable how he did it. At the Climax Molybdenum Company, 50 years
  ago, at 25, he succeeded in enlisting the support of a mining company to
  support astronomy: on the basis, we can be sure, of the infectious enthusiasm
  that would later make him as beloved among industrialists as in science.
  Funding for the major observatory building at Climax, built in 1954, and for a
  new HAO building on the campus of the university, which he built in 1960, came
  not from NASA or federal or state grants, but from 35 private and foundation
  contributors, whose trust and affection Roberts had earned while in his late
  30's and early 40's. They included the Great Western Sugar Company, The Adolph
  Coors Company, and The Denver Union Stockyard.</p>

  <p>Roberts was a joyful enthusiast who made what was hard look easy. For
  twenty years he held the High Altitude Observatory together through a sequence
  of hard times, in such a way that once his staff worked without pay for a
  month to keep the observatory going. To what he built, as to whom he met, he
  remained forever a friend. To meet him was to feel important.</p>

  <p>Roberts enjoyed world renown and was at the same time the most selfless of
  men. In a world of euphemisms and business cards he didn't allow himself to be
  called a "director" of the new observatory until it was 7 years old,
  preferring the more modest title of "superintendent." In a profession of
  corporate travellers he never allowed himself to ride along on the eclipse
  expeditions of the observatory. As the leader of HAO and of NCAR and UCAR he
  went out of his way to avoid taking undue credit, or even that which was
  clearly due. He was as much at home with the humblest of his employees as he
  was with the directors of NCAR and UCAR or the chief executive officers of the
  many corporations and foundations with whom he dealt. He walked with kings and
  never lost the common touch.</p>
