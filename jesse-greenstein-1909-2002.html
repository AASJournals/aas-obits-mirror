<div>
  <p>On the 21 October 2002, with the death of Jesse Greenstein, many of us in
  astronomy lost a beloved adopted father and astronomy lost one of its most
  influential leaders of the postwar era. Truly a giant is gone; it is easy to
  say that they don't make the likes of Greenstein, Spitzer, and Scharwarzschild
  any more, but it is unfortunately only the truth. The field has changed and
  grown enormously in the more than 50 years spanned by Jesse's career with no
  small part of this traceable directly to his efforts.</p>

  <p>His growth was shaped very much by world events. He enjoyed a quite
  comfortable childhood; he was born on 15 October 1909 to successful immigrant
  parents, Maurice and Leah, who indulged his early interests in astronomy,
  radio, and science in general; these interests were to remain with him the
  rest of his life. As a boy he thought physics dull and chemistry exciting,
  though later he was to be influential in the transformation of astronomy into
  astrophysics in this country. He was something of a prodigy, entering the
  Horace Mann School for boys (an excellent private high school) at age 11 and
  Harvard at age 16 (in 1926). He met and became close friends with Cecilia
  Payne, with whom he shared cultural and scientific passions. She was certainly
  the greatest female astronomer of the era but largely shunned and ignored by
  her colleagues. Thus began a curious ambivalence in his relationship with
  women in the field; in fact and in action he was highly supportive but much
  less so in word. He graduated with a BA in astronomy in October 1929, on the
  eve of the stock market crash. He stayed for one more year and obtained a
  Master's degree, prevented by ill health from a planned one-year visit to
  Oxford.</p>

  <p>His family had always assumed that he would forego his interest in research
  and take his place in the family's successful business and real estate
  endeavors and the seriousness of the market collapse impelled him, very much
  against his will, to do just that. He proved himself to be a capable manager,
  able to deal with difficult times and circumstances, and the family business
  prospered. However, his itch to be an astronomer did not falter, and in 1934,
  when he was convinced that the family business would survive without him, he
  returned to Harvard - over the objection of director Harlow Shapely who tried
  to persuade him that the field had advanced too far in his four-year absence
  for him ever to catch up!</p>

  <p>This same year he married his childhood sweetheart Naomi Kitay, whom he
  ever after affectionately called 'Kitty.' Naomi nourished the already-strong
  humanist streak in Jesse. Interested in, and passionate about, art and the
  theater, life in general, and whatever it was that absorbed her interest at
  the moment, she was a wonderful foil for Jesse's self-deprecatory and
  sometimes depressive moods. She died a few months before Jesse did; they had
  been married 66 years.</p>

  <p>At Harvard he pursued a very successful and prescient thesis on the
  scattering of light by interstellar grains, begun perhaps partly in an
  endeavor to alleviate his failure during a Master's research project to
  recognize the existence of dust absorption and reddening in the face of quite
  convincing data. His last days at Harvard were premonitory of things to come
  in his career. He and Fred Whipple wrote a paper attempting, quite
  unsuccessfully, to explain Karl Jansky's detection of strong radio emission
  from the center of the Galaxy as thermal emission; this was long before the
  existence of magnetic fields and relativistic electrons were even suspected.
  The problem was to wait 15 years for a solution. But Jansky's, and later Grote
  Reber's, observations resonated with Jesse's early interest in radio and
  presaged his later decisive support for radio astronomy in the U.S.</p>

  <p>In 1937 he was awarded a NRC fellowship, which he took to Yerkes
  Observatory. Attracted by the innovative and productive group assembled there
  by Otto Struve, he flourished. Still working on dust and the interstellar
  medium, he began a long and productive collaboration with theorist Louis
  Henyey. He also began his career in stellar spectroscopy at Struve's urging
  and did the first analysis of the peculiar hydrogen-poor object upsilon
  Sagittarii, thus beginning a love affair with peculiar stars and their
  compositions which was to last the rest of his career.</p>

  <p>During the war he and Henyey, as well as a number of other astronomers,
  managed to stay at Yerkes, largely putting aside astronomical research to work
  on the war effort. He and Henyey learned optics in the face of great
  difficulty (modern optical design techniques at the time being almost
  exclusively both proprietary and German) and produced many optical designs for
  the military, among which is the beautiful wide-angle, Henyey-Greenstein
  camera.</p>

  <p>After the war Jesse became very interested in, and supportive of, the vast
  changes to the field wrought by the technological developments during the war,
  including infrared detectors, photomultipliers, sensitive radio receivers, and
  rockets. Astronomy clearly stood on the threshold of a new and wonderful era,
  which he was determined to help usher in.</p>

  <p>The astronomical community had already recognized Jesse's genius and in
  1948 he received an invitation he could not possibly refuse. He was invited to
  come to Caltech to build a department to do science with the soon to be
  completed 200-inch Hale telescope, by far the largest and most ambitious
  telescope project to that date. The family (there were now two sons, George
  and Peter) moved from the little town of Williams Bay, Wisconsin to the bustle
  of postwar Pasadena, California. One may well ask whether anyone, given an
  opportunity of this magnitude, could have failed to be great but the answer, I
  am certain, is that it would have been very easy indeed. It took all of
  Jesse's hard-won ability as a manager, his wonderful personal touch, his ease
  with moneyed supporters, and above all his unimpeachable scientific and
  personal integrity to build what is universally recognized as one of the
  finest departments in the world. The arcane political arrangements with the
  Carnegie Institution, which ran Mount Wilson and would later run both Mount
  Wilson and Palomar jointly with Caltech, were hammered out with Jesse's
  guidance before he had a chance to build the department. In the beginning the
  only two astronomers at Caltech were Jesse and Fritz Zwicky; Zwicky was a
  genius but personally incredibly difficult and Jesse was very much alone in
  navigating the difficult political waters.</p>

  <p>His view of the way to build the department, which time has certainly
  vindicated, was to hire the best international theorists he could find. He was
  convinced they were the smartest people being trained at that time and
  convinced as well that the lure of the great telescope would transform them
  into capable observers who would soon understand their data from an
  astrophysical perspective. This was wildly successful. He built a postdoctoral
  program around stellar abundance determinations, funded by the Air Force and
  aided by the many military contacts he had made during and after the war. He
  managed, in his tiny department, to lure the most able students in the field.
  The list of names among the early students and the ``graduates" of the
  abundance project is a who's who of astronomy: Allan Sandage, Helmut Abt,
  George Wallerstein, Halton Arp, Wallace Sargent, Leonard Searle, to name only
  a representative few.</p>

  <p>His own research continued unabated; he returned to the subject of dust
  with Leverett Davis and, in 1951, they proposed the magnetic alignment
  mechanism to explain interstellar polarization that survives essentially
  unchanged to the present - certainly one of the longest-lived theoretical
  results in the field. At Caltech's Kellogg Radiation Laboratory, there was
  much interest in the nuclear reactions that provide stars their energy and
  potentially result in observable abundance changes. This work fit
  hand-in-glove with Jesse's interest in stars of peculiar abundance and he
  forged close scientific ties with the Kellogg team, particularly Willy Fowler.
  Jesse arranged a controversial visit to Caltech by Fred Hoyle (Hoyle's steady
  state cosmology was not popular among Caltech physicists) and Hoyle's protégés
  Geoff and Margaret Burbidge. Their classic work with Fowler on nucleosynthesis
  arose from this visit. Later his research turned increasingly toward
  understanding the denizens of the lower left of the Hertzsprung-Russell
  diagram - white dwarfs, blue subdwarfs, and nuclei of planetary nebulae. He
  became the observational authority on such stars, and much of our current
  understanding of these objects is a direct outgrowth of his work. In the
  course of this work he obtained several spectra of faint blue objects with
  weak, broad emission lines that were not readily identifiable. The realization
  that compact stars could have very strong magnetic fields was then current,
  and he felt that most of these objects could be explained by peculiar Zeeman
  and pressure effects on the spectra of intrinsically faint degenerate objects.
  The quasar story has been told many times, but the realization by Maarten
  Schmidt in 1963 that the spectrum of 3C273 was consistent with a redshift of
  16 percent led them to reassess Jesse's work on 3C48, a quasi-stellar radio
  source with a spectrum similar to some of the peculiar blue "stars" in his
  library of spectra: this turned out to be the second QSO redshift recognized,
  with a value of 0.37. In 1960, Jesse had obtained a spectrum of Ton 202, which
  he had confidently identified as a peculiar DC white dwarf 40 pc distant. When
  he went through his library of spectra with an eye toward new possibilities,
  it turned out to be a QSO with a redshift of 0.37, continuing his penchant for
  being right almost all the time, but with the occasional really spectacular
  mistake.</p>

  <p>He characterized his research and the rather frequent and profound changes
  of direction in a very characteristic way - he very actively wanted to skim
  the cream off new subjects and establish correct directions for research, but
  he did not care for pedantic detail. It is clear from his record that this did
  not mean that he was ill equipped to dig deeply; his work on dust in
  particular was very difficult stuff. He simply felt that he had the tools at
  his disposal to help at the very frontiers of astronomical research and
  preferred to leave the details to others.</p>

  <p>Even before he came to Caltech in 1948, Jesse was convinced by the work of
  Jansky and Reber, and later the British and Australians, that radio astronomy
  was of vast importance to the field, and he was determined that Caltech should
  be a center. He fought for the founding of a radio astronomy group by first
  gaining institutional acceptance - which was not easy - and then obtaining
  federal funding for the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) in 1954 from the
  Office of Naval Research. In this context, it is important to note that
  astronomy in the U.S. had been, for a very long time, almost exclusively
  privately funded and the Caltech abundance project and the radio astronomy
  observatory were among the first large departures from this norm. Jesse's task
  was made even more difficult by the connection with the Carnegie Institution,
  which at the time had specific rules against seeking federal funds.</p>

  <p>He gradually built Caltech astronomy into the powerhouse it has been for
  many years. Along the way he fostered and welcomed promising new technology,
  beginning with photomultipliers, through radio astronomy techniques, vidicons,
  CCDs, and computers. His views on computers as tools for doing theory, namely
  that they basically trivialize theoretical research (he would not have said it
  ``exactly" that way) would certainly be very unpopular today.</p>

  <p>Jesse's role on the national scene was profound and controversial. He was
  instrumental in persuading the Navy and Air Force to fund astronomical
  research and he was active in the founding of the National Science Foundation;
  he chaired the first NSF advisory committee in astronomy. He served on
  countless government advisory committees and worked with other Caltech
  physicists in highly classified research until well after such work became
  highly unpopular on campuses. He pushed very hard for the founding of the
  national observatories, particularly NRAO. He was one of the organizers of the
  conference in 1954, which was explicitly aimed at convincing the government to
  establish NRAO - the same year he obtained funds from the Navy to build
  Caltech's private OVRO, which was for a long time in direct competition with
  the national observatory. He was also influential in the founding of the
  national optical observatory at Kitt Peak, though this was to be a very
  contentious issue later. He was chosen in 1970 to lead the second National
  Academy decade review of astronomy, after the ground breaking Whitford report
  a decade earlier. It is generally conceded that the Greenstein report was the
  most successful of these efforts to date in the face of a rather austere
  funding climate; this effort was aided by the cohesive spirit of the
  community, but also because of the wisdom that he brought to the
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>His view on the best way to conduct science was explicitly and very frankly
  intellectually elitist. The very best people at the very best institutions, he
  thought, should be supported to the fullest extent possible with money and
  technological support wherever it could be found. He had built the Caltech
  department from a gleam in George Ellery Hale's eye to one of the preeminent
  astronomical research institution in the world, and was proud of it. He felt
  that the nation owed it to science for its own sake and as a nation to support
  science fully. He wrote in his memoir, ``An Astronomical Life," in the "Annual
  Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics": ``Human illness and poverty cannot be
  cured merely by spending money, but the human condition can be ennobled by
  spending money wisely." He did not think that spending vast amounts of money
  at Kitt Peak to build giant telescopes for the whole community was the best
  way to spend said vast amounts of money. He felt that the elite universities
  had demonstrated the ability both to build big instruments (the 200-inch, the
  120-inch) and to attract the astronomical staff to operate them and to do
  superb science with them. If the federal government were to spend the money,
  it should clearly go to those universities. In any event, these universities
  should not be allowed to wither as the national observatories grew. Curiously,
  his view of NRAO was very different and he personally was enthusiastic about
  the construction of the VLA; indeed, it was the highest-priority project of
  the Greenstein report.</p>

  <p>In any document such as this, one must mention offices and awards. Jesse
  was awarded and held most of them: the Gold Medal of the RAS, the Russell
  Lectureship, the Bruce Medal, the Vice Presidency of the AAS, a
  (controversial) chairmanship of AURA, membership in the National Academy,
  chairmanship of many of its, and other government, advisory committees as well
  as chairmanship of the decadal review. He held the first Lee DuBridge chair at
  Caltech. While he was appreciative of these awards, he felt that awards and
  honors usually came too late in a scientist's career to be useful.</p>

  <p>He was a superb scientist and skillful manager and administrator, but no
  description of Jesse, especially this memorial one, can possibly be complete
  without some attempt to describe him as a human being. It was shortly before
  the QSO era, in 1961, that I, as a green graduate student, first met Jesse. I
  was in awe, of course, but it soon became clear that there was not even a
  stern exterior to this remarkable man who had built the Caltech department,
  and who was very much a personification of American astronomy. He cared deeply
  about everyone in his department and clearly prided himself as an amateur
  psychologist. He was always available, charming, warm, and open, and eager to
  discuss and help with personal problems as well as scientific ones with
  seemingly equal willingness and enthusiasm. Naomi was called in for help with
  stubborn personal problems and their house on San Pasqual street was a warm,
  inviting place and the location of countless formal and raucous informal
  parties and gatherings. I never worked with him directly as a student, but
  felt that I knew him better than any of the faculty with whom I did work. All
  of the words I have read in tribute to Jesse mention him as a father; he was
  certainly mine, and I (and all of his many children) will miss him
  terribly.</p>
