      <h1>Joyce M. Rey Watson (1922-2001)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Joyce Rey-Watson was a librarian who specialized in searching online
  astronomical databases. As such, she became a member of the American
  Astronomical Society. In the 1980s and 1990s she became a well-known figure at
  AAS meetings where she set up computers and demonstrated techniques for online
  searching of astronomical databases.</p>

  <p>Born in England on 9 August 1922, Joyce was trained there in library
  science. She began in the field of government documents control and then
  became the head librarian for two engineering companies. After she emigrated
  to the United States, she took time out to raise her family before she resumed
  her career in Massachusetts. She first started at Lowell Technological
  Institute, where she developed and ran a small research library. Next, she
  ventured into Cambridge where joined the staff of Smithsonian Astrophysical
  Observatory in December 1969 as the SAO Branch Librarian.</p>

  <p>Looking to the future, Joyce decided in 1976 to take a course in online
  database searching at the University of Pittsburgh. It was a pivotal point in
  her career. Soon thereafter, she brought online literature searching to
  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. By 1986 she had learned about SIMBAD,
  an acronym that stands for Set of Identifications, Measurements, and
  Bibliography for Astronomical Data. It was just at that time that the Centre
  de Donnees Astronomiques de Strasbourg in France was eager to expand the usage
  of their object-based database. Joyce was ready to participate. In those early
  days of SIMBAD, she did all the searching with primitive technology: a
  300-1200 baud modem, a telephone with an overseas service contract, and a line
  printer.</p>

  <p>During the 1980s Joyce was also a founding member of PAM, the
  Physics-Astronomy-Math Division of the Special Libraries Association.
  Throughout her membership in PAM she served in many capacities: Chair of the
  Astronomy Workshop in 1982-1983; Chair-elect and Conference Program Chair in
  1984-1985; Chair of PAM in 1985-1986; Chair Of the Nominating Committee in
  1988-1989; and Co-chair with Brenda Corbin of the Long Range/Strategic
  Planning Committee in 1989-1990.</p>

  <p>From 1991 until January 1997, when she retired from SAO, Joyce worked
  primarily on SIMBAD and ADS, the Astrophysics Data System, with which she had
  also become involved in its infancy. In retirement, she moved to California to
  be close to her family and to undergo treatment of lung cancer, with which she
  was diagnosed in July 2000. She is survived by her three daughters, Toni,
  Pamela, and Lilli Rey, her eight grandchildren, and her husband, Alan
  Watson.</p>

  <p>This obituary is based on material supplied by her family and by the staff
  of the John G. Wolbach Library at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
  Astrophysics.</p>
