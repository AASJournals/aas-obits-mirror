      <h1>Sol H. Genatt (1921-1992)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Sol Genatt was for thirty years an astronomer for several federal agencies.
  Born in New York City, he was an aerial navigator during World War II for the
  US Army Air Corps. He obtained a B.A. in Astronomy at Cornell University in
  1947 and began work in the Nautical Almanac Office of the US Naval
  Observatory. Later he worked in the time Service Division field station in
  Richmond, Florida, observing with a photographic zenith tube. During the 1950s
  he also worked in the Research and Analysis Branch of the US Army Map Service
  under John A. O'Keefe. At first lunar occultations of stars were observed for
  improved terrestrial coordinates, but once artificial satellites became a
  reality, Genatt became involved in developing equipment and planning programs
  to track satellites for geodetic purposes.</p>

  <p>From 1960 to 1976 Genatt was Station Manager at the Goddard Optical
  Research Facility, a part of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
  Under his direction this facility was involved with a variety of projects on
  laser ranging and laser tracking of satellites. In 1964 this included using a
  20-inch telescope to detect laser pulses reflected from corner cubes mounted
  on the Beacon series of satellites. In the early 1970s he assisted in the
  creation of two satellite-tracking stations in California on either side of
  the San Andreas Fault.</p>
