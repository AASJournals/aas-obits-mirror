  <p><strong>Alexei M. Khokhlov died on Saturday the 4<sup>th</sup> of May
  2019.</strong></p>

  <p>Alexei Moisseyevich Khokhlov was born in Moscow on April 22, 1954. He
  died at age 65 from complications related to treatments for
  esthesioneuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer.</p>

  <p>Alexei’s parents were prominent physicists, Vera L. Khokhlova and Moissey
  Z. Khokhlov. He spent his childhood at the Crimean Astrophysical
  Observatory, where his parents worked until he started school in 1961 in
  Moscow. In 1980 he graduated from Moscow State University with Honors. He
  completed his Ph. D. in 1983 at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and
  started working at what is currently known as the Institute of Astronomy of
  the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1991-1992 he worked as a Visiting Fellow
  at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, near Munich.
  Between 1992 and 1996 he worked at the University of Texas in Austin, as a
  Postdoctoral Associate, then a Research Associate, and finally as a Research
  Scientist. He then spent seven years as a Research Physicist at the Naval
  Research Laboratory in Washington, DC. In 2003 he became a Professor in the
  Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Enrico Fermi Institute at
  the University of Chicago.</p>

  <p>Alexei is best known for his fundamental contributions to our
  understanding of thermonuclear-powered supernovae (exploding white dwarf
  stars). These explosions are so bright they can be seen at immense
  distances. They are therefore a key tool astronomers use to measure
  distances and thereby determine the cosmological parameters of the universe.
  They are also a major source of the heavy elements in the universe and the
  primary source of iron-peak elements.</p>

  <p>When Alexei began working on thermonuclear-powered supernovae, the
  canonical model was a white dwarf star with a mass near 1.4 solar masses
  (the Chandrasekhar mass limit) accreting matter from a binary companion star
  (like the Sun, or perhaps a giant star). As the mass of the white dwarf star
  gradually grows, the density in its center increases until the mixture of
  carbon and oxygen in its core ignites. Astrophysicists proposed that a
  supersonic burning wave (called a “detonation wave”) would then sweep
  through the star, incinerating all of the matter in it and exploding the
  star.</p>

  <p>However, spectroscopic observations showed that the debris of an
  exploding white dwarf consists of both intermediate-mass elements and
  heavier iron-peak elements. This posed a problem for the detonation-wave
  model. Burning via an ordinary flame would create intermediate-mass elements
  but no iron-peak elements and would release far too little energy. On the
  other hand, burning via a detonation wave would release enough energy and
  create iron-peak elements. But it would create almost no intermediate-mass
  elements.</p>

  <p>To solve this conundrum, Alexei proposed the delayed-detonation model in
  which burning begins as an ordinary nuclear flame but transitions to a
  supersonic detonation wave, thus enabling enough energy to be released and
  both intermediate-mass and iron-peak elements to be produced. Essentially
  all thermonuclear-powered supernova models considered today are of this
  type. Alexei was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society for his
  contributions to supernova science.</p>

  <p>Alexei was also known for his ingenuity in the development of gauge
  instabilities in 3+1 (three space dimensions plus time) formulations of
  General Relativity. Alexei had a talent for simplifying complex problems and
  finding toy examples that mimic the main problem in order to understand how
  to tackle it. He was able to do this at a time when no one knew how to solve
  Einstein’s equations numerically. Alexei was also interested in theoretical
  aspects of black holes, and had also studied the physics of the interior of
  a spherical, charged black hole with a scalar field. This work is highly
  cited in the field, since it found interesting phenomenology for
  singularities in the interiors of black holes.</p>

  <p>Alexei liked cross-country car trips that involved camping and hiking in
  national parks. He was an avid photographer and reader. He traveled across
  the United States several times in his trusty 4 Runner and took thousands of
  digital images. We hope to have a public display of the best of those
  images. Amongst his favorite books were <em>The Tale of Genji</em>, written
  a thousand years ago by Murasaki Shikibu, <em>The Forsyte Saga</em> by John
  Galsworthy, and, particularly,<em> The Master and Margarita</em> by Mikhail
  Bulgakov, because the presence of certain odd characters and the occurrence
  of particularly absurd events seemed somehow fitting in Soviet Russia.
  Alexei also loved classical music. His favorite piece
  was <em>Sheherazade</em> by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.</p>

  <p>Alexei was survived by his wife of 32 years, three children, two
    grandchildren, and one sister.</p>
