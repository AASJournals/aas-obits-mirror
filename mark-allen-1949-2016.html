      <h1>Mark Allen (1949-2016)</h1>

  <p>Mark Andrew Allen, 67, died on 22 October 2016 of complications from ALS
  (Lou Gehrig's Disease). Allen was born in New York City on 29 September 1949.
  His career interest in chemistry was already well established by the time he
  enrolled as an undergraduate at Columbia University. In a 2012 alumni profile,
  he commented, “In my senior year, I learned about the discovery of molecules
  in interstellar space…, an environment where conventional wisdom at the time
  would suggest that molecules shouldn’t exist. I chose this burgeoning field of
  astrochemistry as my future research interest.” (<i>Columbia College
  Today</i>, Winter 2011-2012, p. 75.) Allen graduated Summa Cum Laude and Phi
  Beta Kappa from Columbia in 1971, and subsequently received his Ph.D. from
  Caltech in 1976, both degrees in chemistry.</p>

  <p>Allen returned to New York City for a two-year fellowship at NASA’s Goddard
  Institute for Space Studies, and in 1978 accepted a postdoctoral position in
  planetary sciences at Caltech with Prof. Yuk Yung. He joined the staff of the
  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1981, where he spent the majority of his
  professional career, developing chemical models of planetary and exoplanetary
  atmospheres, comets, and cold interstellar molecular clouds. He was the
  principal designer of the comprehensive chemical code KINETICS, an integrated
  dynamical/chemical computational model for simulating chemical processes in
  planetary atmospheres. Allen was a team member of NASA’s Astrobiology
  Institute (NAI) and Virtual Planet Lab, and was Principal Investigator of
  NAI’s “Titan as a Prebiotic Chemical System” project. He was also involved in
  a number of NASA and ESA missions and mission concepts, including proposals
  for orbiting spacecraft to examine the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and
  Titan.</p>

  <p>Reflecting on his own training, Allen acknowledged the value of a broad
  undergraduate education in his work as a scientist: “I was told by a very
  senior JPL program manager that I prepared the clearest mission proposals he
  had ever read.” A long-time friend writes that Mark Allen “was a regular guy
  who had a sense of humor. He was very sweet, very thoughtful.”</p>
