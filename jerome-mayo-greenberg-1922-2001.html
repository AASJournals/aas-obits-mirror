  <p>J. Mayo Greenberg, a leading experimental astrochemist and expert on
  cometary structure and composition, died of pancreatic cancer in his home in
  Leiden, The Netherlands, on 29 November 2001. Though born in Baltimore,
  Maryland on 14 January 1922, and educated at Johns Hopkins University,
  Greenberg had immigrated to The Netherlands in 1975, and it was there that his
  cometary expertise matured.</p>

  <p>Greenberg was an exceptional child, entering Johns Hopkins University to
  study physics when he was only fifteen years old, and advancing to graduate
  studies, also in physics, in just over two additional years. His academic
  career was interrupted by war-related research during the 1940s, but Greenberg
  returned to Johns Hopkins to complete his PhD in 1948 with a dissertation on
  the scattering of radiation by matter. During his academic career in the
  United States, Greenberg held appointments at the University of Delaware,
  University of Maryland, Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Rensselaer
  Polytechnic Institute, Dudley Observatory and The State University of New York
  at Albany, where he served as chairman of the physics department.</p>

  <p>Greenberg’s interests gradually broadened from theoretical to experimental
  work while at the same time his interest in astronomy, in particular the
  problems related to how scattering processes polarized, reddened and blocked
  light in space, continued to deepen. A sabbatical year, and a year as a
  visiting professor, both at Leiden and in close contact with Henk van de Hulst
  and Jan Oort who had similar interests, were sufficient to persuade Greenberg
  that relocation to The Netherlands would be of interest. When van de Hulst
  persuaded Leiden University to invest in a chair for laboratory astrophysics,
  Greenberg was a natural choice for the position. Greenberg moved to The
  Netherlands in 1975, and resided in Leiden for the remainder of his life.
  Until his retirement in 1992, Greenberg was director of the Huygens
  Astrophysical Laboratory at Leiden University.</p>

  <p>At Leiden, Greenberg’s achievements included the laboratory synthesis of
  complex organic molecules from smaller molecules under laboratory conditions
  simulating those prevailing in space. He went on to demonstrate that such
  molecules evolved into even more complex refractory organic molecules when
  exposed in space to the actual radiation that exists there. Samples of
  laboratory produced “yellow stuff” changed, after exposure in actual space
  conditions, into a dirty brown colored material. Space missions to Comet
  Halley determined that this color emulates the actual surface of that comet,
  while spectroscopic studies confirm that the two exhibit similar molecular
  structures. The question of the possible origin of life on earth as we know it
  fascinated Greenberg. In his laboratory he was able to demonstrate that space
  conditions not only permitted the synthesis of complex molecules on the
  surface of dust particles, but also that those molecules could be produced in
  stereospecific forms by the strong, circularly polarized ultraviolet radiation
  in dusty gas clouds surrounding neutron stars. The recent discovery of
  stereospecific forms of organic molecules in space provided a solid
  confirmation of this elegant laboratory research.</p>

  <p>In the past quarter century, as George K. Milley described it in an
  internet tribute to Greenberg posted immediately after he died, “…the
  laboratory that Greenberg created has produced a constant stream of
  fundamental research papers, and cultivated a series of brilliant students who
  have gone on to be scientific leaders themselves. Although the Leiden
  Laboratory was the first such facility, there are now several comparable
  laboratories throughout the world, some of which are led by ex-students or
  staff of the Leiden Lab.”</p>

  <p>In 1947, Greenberg married Naomi Slovin, who survives him together with
  their two daughters, two sons and grandchildren.</p>

  <p>This obituary essay is
  drawn from both a copy of Milley’s internet tribute (<a
  href="http://www.strw.LeidenUniv.nl/mayo.mayo.html">http://www.strw.LeidenUniv.nl/mayo.mayo.html</a>)
  provided by Naomi Greenberg, and from a lengthy and excellent obituary
  published in the International Comet Quarterly (Marcus, Joseph N. “J. Mayo
  Greenberg (1922–2001)”, 23, 4(2001 October):153-155). The latter covers
  Greenberg’s extensive contributions to comet theory and provides a useful list
  of relevant technical literature in astronomy, astrophysics and astrobiology.</p>
