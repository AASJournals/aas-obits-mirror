      <h1>John E. Baer (1947-1998)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>John Baer was born on April 21, 1947. He majored in astronomy at the
  University of Washington, obtaining his BS degree in 1970 and his MS in 1973.
  For a few years he taught at North Seattle Community College, but left to join
  his family’s home furnishings store, Carpet World, where he became president
  of the company. His computer skills proved to be very useful in updating the
  company’s accounting, inventory, etc. John had many interests in addition to
  astronomy, including painting, poetry, and music. In fact, he had his own
  studio for recording and even wrote some compositions.</p>

  <p>He died in March of 1998 after an unsuccessful fight against kidney cancer.
  He very kindly donated his library to at the Astronomy Department of the
  University of Washington and, by his will, established an endowed scholarship
  fund for undergraduates.</p>
