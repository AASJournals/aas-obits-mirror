  <p>Ronald Anthony Schorn was born on February 5, 1935, and was raised in Oak
  Park and Chicago, Illinois. He attended Loyola University and graduated in
  1956 with an honors degree in physics; he minored in chemistry and math. He
  then earned a master’s degree in nuclear physics at the University of Illinois
  in Urbana. With the launch of Sputnik by the USSR on October 4, 1957, America
  was in a panic, and the nation quickly became motivated to keep pace with the
  Soviets by investing in the education of many, many scientists and engineers.
  The University of Illinois initiated a new doctoral program in astronomy, and
  Schorn switched fields to become one of their first astronomy doctoral
  students. After the completion of his Ph.D. (Schorn 1963) under the
  supervision of Stanley Wyatt, he moved to Pasadena, California, where he
  worked on the Apollo missions at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

  <p>Schorn spent a year in Washington, D.C., as the first Director of the
  Planetary Sciences Division of NASA. While at NASA he helped secure funding to
  build the 2.7-m reflector at the University of Texas’s McDonald
  Observatory.</p>

  <p>During the 1960s Schorn became a key player in spectroscopic studies of the
  atmosphere of Mars. Using a number of 2- to 3-m class telescopes in the
  American Southwest in combination with high-resolution spectrographs, he was
  able to measure the precipitable water vapor content on Mars over the course
  of its seasons. As he points out in a review on the subject (Schorn 1971), the
  <i>effective</i> discovery of water on Mars was accomplished by Kaplan et al.
  (1964), but the results were not universally accepted. In 1969 the
  observations by Schorn and Stephen Little were highlighted in a two-column
  article in <i>Time</i> magazine (Anonymous 1969). The first definitive
  quantitative results were obtained by the Mariner 9 satellite, which arrived
  at Mars in late 1971 and whose mission lasted until October 1972 (Conrath et
  al. 1973).</p>

  <p>From JPL Schorn moved to College Station, Texas, where he taught astronomy
  and meteorology at Texas A&amp;M University from 1973 to 1981. From 1981 to
  1992 he was Technical Editor of <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> magazine. This was
  during the era when the magazine was a “must read” by amateurs and
  professionals alike. Then, after a decade in New England, which included the
  hobby of being a Revolutionary War re-enactor with the Menotomy Minute Men of
  Arlington, Massachusetts, he returned to College Station, where he wrote two
  books on the history of space exploration (Schorn 1998, Dethloff and Schorn
  2003).</p>

  <p>Schorn was an avid reader and storyteller, and like many a good
  storyteller, he often regaled his listeners using a measure of artistic
  license. One of his notable literary accomplishments is that he was the first
  to correctly identify the prototype of Sherlock Holmes’s nemesis James
  Moriarty as the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb.</p>

  <p>In 1999 Schorn contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome and lay in bed for nearly
  a year, first in the hospital, then at home. His recovered primarily because
  his wife, who was a nurse, cared for him.</p>

  <p>One day in the fall of 2018 Schorn fainted. This was attributed to
  arrhythmia of his heart. Before a pacemaker could be implanted, he died of
  heart failure.</p>

  <p>He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Marcia; their five children, Peter,
  Ellen, Paul, Cathy, and Susan; one nephew; and six grandchildren. As his
  daughter Susan wrote, “The world feels a little smaller without him, but, as
  he would have reminded us, the universe is still expanding.”</p>
