  <p>Renowned scientist Dr. Abolghassem Ghaffari, who had taught at Harvard and
  Princeton Universities, passed away Tuesday night at 10:55pm in Los Angeles.
  He was 106 years old. In the early part of his career, he was Albert
  Einstein's colleague at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
  University under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer. On October 12th, he
  was honored at Harvard University for his lifetime achievements.</p>

  <p>Born in Tehran in 1907, he was educated at Darolfonoun School (Tehran).
  In 1929, he went to France and studied Mathematics and Physics at Nancy
  University, where he took his L-es-Sc. in Mathematics in 1932. After obtaining
  post-graduate diplomas in Physics, Astronomy, and Higher Analysis, he obtained
  in 1936 his doctorate from the Sorbonne (Doctor of Sciences with “Mention tres
  honorable”) for basic research on Mathematical Study of Brownian Motion.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ghaffari lectured as a Research Associate at King’s College (London
  University), where he received his Ph.D. from the Mathematics Department on
  the “Velocity-Correction Factors and the Hodograph Method in Gas Dynamics.” As
  a Fulbright Scholar, he worked at Harvard University as a Research Associate
  to lecture on Differential Equations and to continue his research on Gas
  Dynamics.</p>

  <p>He was a Research Associate in Mathematics at Princeton
  University, and at the Institute for Advanced Study, he worked in the early
  1950s withAlbert Einstein on the Unified Field Theory of Gravitation and
  Electromagnetism. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who headed the U.S. atom bomb program
  during World War II, was director of the Institute at the time and interviewed
  Ghaffari before the latter became a member of the Institute (Oppenheimer later
  befriended Ghaffari).</p>

  <p>He has lectured as a Professor of Mathematics
  at American University in Washington, DC and at Tehran University, where he
  joined the Faculty of Sciences and was appointed full Professor of Higher
  Analysis from 1941 to 1956.</p>

  <p>In 1956, Ghaffari moved permanently to
  the U.S. to take up a position as a senior mathematician at theU.S. National
  Bureau of Standards. Part of his work there involved calculations of the
  motion of artificial satellites.</p>

  <p>In 1964, three years into the
  manned space program, he joined, as aerospace scientist, the National
  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center, where
  he studied the mathematical aspects of different optimization techniques
  involved in the Earth-Moon trajectory problems, and different analytical
  methods for multiple midcourse maneuvers in interplanetary guidance. He later
  investigated the effects of solar radiation pressure on the Radio Astronomy
  Explorer Satellite Booms as well as the effects of General Relativity on the
  orbits of Artificial Earth Satellites.</p>

  <p>He was awarded in Iran the
  Imperial Orders of the late Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, and the U.S. Special
  Apollo Achievement award (1969) at a White House ceremony with President
  Nixon. He has published more than 50 papers on Pure and Applied Mathematics in
  American, British, and French, and Persian periodicals. In addition to two
  textbooks, he is author of the mathematical book “The Hodograph Method in Gas
  Dynamics” (1950).</p>

  <p>In 2005, Ghaffari received the Distinguished
  Scholar award from the Association of Professors and Scholars of Iranian
  Heritage (APSIH) at UCLA. In 2007, he received a proclamation from former
  Beverly Hills mayor and current Goodwill Ambassador Jimmy Delshad
  acknowledging his numerous lifetime achievements. He also recently was
  appointed as a Hall of Fame inductee by SINA (Spirit of Noted Achievers) at
  Harvard University.</p>

  <p>He is also a past member of the Iranian
  National Commission of UNESCO. Ghaffari is a Fellow of the New York Academy of
  Sciences, the Washington Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for
  the Advancement of Sciences and a member of the London Mathematical Society,
  the American Mathematical Society, The Mathematical Association of America,
  and the American Astronomical Society.</p>

  <p>He is survived by his wife,
  Mitra, and his two daughters, Ida and Vida. He is interred at Pierce Brothers
  Valhalla Memorial Park in Burbank, California.</p>
