      <h1>Henry Albers (1925-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Henry Albers, professor of astronomy at Vassar College for over thirty
  years, died March 29, 2009, in Fairhope, Alabama. For his work at Vassar,
  where he held the Maria Mitchell Chair, Albers received the first Maria
  Mitchell Women in Science Award for his inspiration of women astronomers. He
  said "In the final analysis it is the students who bring the joy into
  teaching." As a professional astronomer, Albers did observational work on
  Galactic structure in the southern Milky Way, and on the structure of the
  Magellanic Clouds. In retirement, Albers published <i>Maria Mitchell - A Life
  in Journals and Letters,</i> the firsthand account of America's first woman
  astronomer.</p>

  <p>Albers’s research was on photographic near-infrared spectroscopy of red
  giant stars in the southern Milky Way, some proper motion studies, and on the
  structure of the Magellanic Clouds. A series of seven NSF grants supported his
  six trips to Chile to make spectroscopic observations, as well as his
  sabbatical collaborations at Minnesota, Leiden, and the Royal Observatory in
  Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Henry Albers arrived at Vassar in 1958, to find an astronomy program that
  had been recently absorbed by the physics department, and that was suffering
  neglect after the retirement of Maud Makemson. For the next 31 years, with
  incredible energy— he sometimes taught seven courses a year—he built the
  astronomy program into one double in size (from one to two tenure lines),
  whose 19<sup>th</sup> century facilities have been replaced with a
  21<sup>st</sup> century observatory. For a remarkable stretch of
  20-some-years, Albers and physicist Bob Stearns, with considerable grace,
  alternated chairmanship of the joint department of physics and astronomy.
  Henry Albers was a devoted citizen of Vassar College and an enthusiastic
  participant in the process of faculty governance at that institution. He would
  have been the first to concede that his enthusiasm was sometimes excessive,
  and that his contributions at faculty meetings occasionally failed to move the
  discussion forward. Before more than one meeting, he was known to make a note
  to himself on his copy of the agenda, which read, in large block letters:
  “shut up.” Fortunately, Albers was seldom able to repress his concern for the
  College or his dedication to its improvement. He served on all major
  committees and most minor ones as well. For example, he chaired a committee
  that eventually got telephones in faculty offices, another that lobbied for
  establishment of an academic computing center, and another that constructed
  Vassar’s system of post-tenure review of senior faculty. It was Henry Albers
  who introduced the motion on the floor of the faculty, which passed by a vote
  of 100 to 2, moving that Vassar College accept coeducation. Albers was a
  caring mentor and although fundamentally compassionate, had a somewhat
  prankish sense of humor—unfailingly directed at the most pompous targets in
  sight.</p>

  <p>Although deeply dedicated to the College, Albers had an admirable ability
  to disengage from his life at Vassar. He regularly spent college breaks as the
  resident astronomer on cruise ships. Every May, he would celebrate his last
  class by sharing a jug of wine in the faculty commons with his regular
  lunchtime group. After retiring in 1989, he continued his hobbies of
  gardening, painting, and choral singing, but also immediately began work as a
  math and science volunteer in the local public schools on Cape Cod. He
  completed his final scholarly project, his edition of the Letters and Journals
  of Maria Mitchell, in 2002.</p>
