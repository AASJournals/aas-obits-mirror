  <p>Kinsey A. Anderson, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of
  California, Berkeley, and a pioneer in the field now called space physics,
  died June 11, 2012, in Pinole, Calif. He was 85 and suffered from Alzheimer’s
  disease.</p>

  <p>Born in Preston, Minn., on Sept. 18, 1926, Anderson
  graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1949 with a B.A. in physics.
  While a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1950s, he
  was a member of the group that first developed balloons that could take
  experiments to high altitudes in order to study cosmic rays and X-rays that
  are blocked by the atmosphere. He was awarded a patent for a novel method of
  measuring stresses in balloon material for different shapes of balloons. For
  his Ph.D. thesis under University of Minnesota professor John Winckler, he
  used the balloon technology to measure cosmic rays at various latitudes and
  altitudes, even launching balloons from a U.S. aircraft carrier in the South
  Pacific. Later, he established, by direct observations at high altitudes, that
  intense fluxes of very energetic protons are emitted by the sun during solar
  flares. Piqued by unexpected X-rays that he and Winckler had discovered
  emanating from the atmosphere above Northern Canada, he also focused on X-ray
  observations.</p>

  <p>After completing his thesis in 1955, he accepted a
  post-doctoral position at the University of Iowa, where he subsequently joined
  the faculty in 1958. He came to the UC Berkeley physics department in 1960 and
  switched to the then-new technology of satellite instrumentation to study
  energetic particles and X-rays from the sun and the earth. During the next 10
  years, he and his students successfully flew instruments on more than a dozen
  spacecraft, including IMP (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform) 1-6, Explorers
  33 and 35, OGO (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory) 5; and on numerous balloons
  and rockets. He convinced NASA that the Apollo 15 and 16 missions, which
  landed on the moon in the early 1970s, should carry subsatellites that could
  be left in lunar orbit. The goal was to measure the shadowing of energetic
  electrons by the moon to determine the motion of Earth’s magnetic tail, but it
  was found that the electron observations could also be used to measure the
  magnetic fields on the surface of the moon. This led to subsequent electron
  reflection magnetometry instruments for the Lunar Prospector and Mars Global
  Surveyor to map the surface magnetic fields of the moon and Mars.</p>

  <p>Anderson served for 10 years (1970-79) as director of UC Berkeley’s Space
  Sciences Laboratory (SSL). As SSL director, he initiated a senior fellow
  program that allowed research scientists to become principal investigators,
  thus able to handle the administrative and technical burdens associated with
  the special needs of space flight programs.</p>

  <p>Anderson was an author
  of approximately 200 papers and trained 24 graduate students on such diverse
  topics as instrument design; auroral, solar and cosmic x-ray emissions;
  energetic particles from the sun, Earth’s bow shock, magnetosphere and tail;
  the plasma physics of Halley’s Comet; and remnant magnetic fields of the moon
  and Mars. His research achievements resulted in his election as a member of
  the National Academy of Sciences. He also received a Guggenheim Fellowship,
  the Space Science Award from the American Institute of Astronautics and
  Aeronautics, a NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, the
  Alexander von Humboldt Award, fellowships in the American Geophysical Union,
  the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement
  of Science, as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Toulouse.
  Upon his retirement from UC Berkeley in 1990, he received the Berkeley
  Citation for distinguished achievement and notable service to the university.
 </p>

  <p>Anderson is survived by his wife, Lilica Anderson (née Vassiliades)
  of El Cerrito; daughters Sindri Anderson of El Cerrito and Danae Anderson of
  Truckee, Calif.; and five grandchildren.</p>
