  <p>Renowned solar physicist and radio astronomer Mukul Ranjan Kundu died on
  17 June 2010 near College Park, Maryland, from complications after an
  automobile accident that occurred when he was returning home from work. A
  recipient of the American Astronomical Society's 2007 George Ellery Hale
  Prize, Mukul spent his entire career studying the radiophysics of the Sun. His
  work significantly advanced the understanding of the interactions between
  accelerated electrons and the magnetized solar corona and of the myriad
  nonthermal radio phenomena that resulted.</p>

  <p>Mukul was born 10 February 1930 in Calcutta, India. After completing his
  college studies in physics and radiophysics at the University of Calcutta, he
  went on to earn his DSc degree in radio astronomy from the University of Paris
  in 1957. His early work involved the study of the terrestrial ionosphere and
  how it is influenced by the Sun. He was also involved in the development of
  radio interferometry when he was in Paris. After a brief stay at the National
  Physical Laboratory in New Delhi, India, Mukul went to the US in 1962, first
  as an associate research physicist at the University of Michigan and then as
  an associate professor at Cornell University. In 1965 he returned to India to
  work for three years at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Then he
  went back to the US to be a professor at the University of Maryland, College
  Park, where he worked until the last day of his life.</p>

  <p>The radio interferometric work he began during his graduate days became
  his prime interest in studying solar phenomena at various wavelengths, from
  millimeters to meters. His 1971 discovery with Timothy McCullough that the
  Sun's north pole was brighter than the surrounding quiet Sun has had a lasting
  impact on our understanding of the connection between the solar wind and the
  Sun's surface features. That phenomenon was later found to be associated with
  coronal holes in the Sun's polar regions and at low latitudes. The enhanced
  radio emission indicates that the chromosphere under coronal holes has
  different physical conditions compared with the quiet chromosphere.</p>

  <p>At the other extreme of radio wavelengths, the early argument by Mukul
  and Robert Stone that the nonthermal electrons responsible for the complex
  type III solar radio bursts observed at kilometric wavelengths are from the
  flare site rather than due to shock acceleration has proved to be of enduring
  usefulness. Mukul did extensive work on solar radio phenomena using
  interferometric arrays such as the Clark Lake Multifrequency Radioheliograph,
  the Nancay Radioheliograph, the Nobeyama Radioheliograph, the Westerbork
  Synthesis Radio Telescope, the Very Large Array, and the Berkeley Illinois
  Maryland Association array.</p>

  <p>Most of the more than 400 research publications Mukul authored or
  coauthored were about the Sun, but a significant number discussed other areas
  of astrophysics: radio galaxies, supernova remnants, nebulae, flare stars, and
  T Tauri stars. He published his influential textbook, Solar Radio Astronomy
  (Wiley), in 1965. He also edited four other books covering solar physics,
  solar radio physics, solar terrestrial physics, and astrophysics.</p>

  <p>Mukul was a member of the editorial board of the journal Solar Physics
  for more than 40 years—from 1967 until his death. For nearly two decades, he
  helped immensely with the success of the research associate programs of the
  National Research Council. He also served as a member of NSF's Advisory Panel
  for Atmospheric Sciences from 1983 to 1986. He trained numerous students and
  young scientists from the US and abroad.</p>

  <p>A great fan of food and wine, Mukul was a regular visitor to the
  Washington, DC, waterfront to get fresh fish. A jovial person, he enjoyed the
  company of his colleagues and will always be remembered for his healthy laugh,
  which identified him in any group conversation or at any dinner table.</p>
