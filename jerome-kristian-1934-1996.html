      <h1>Jerome Kristian (1934-1996)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Jerome Kristian (called Jerry, by his friends) was born 5 June 1934, in
  Wilwaukee, Wisconsin, and died 22 June 1996 in an ultralight airplane
  accident. He attended the University of Chicago, obtaining MS and PhD degrees
  (Physics), the latter in 1962 with a thesis on "Hydromagnetic Equilibrium of a
  Fluid Sphere," supervised by S. Chandrasekhar and published in three
  <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> papers in 1963-64. While at the University of
  Texas (1962-64) as an instructor, Kristian collaborated with R. K. Sachs in
  the preparation of the fundamental paper "Observations in Cosmology"
  (<em>ApJ</em> 1143, 379, 1966).</p>

  <p>Following a short period (1966-67) at the University of Wisconsin as an
  Assistant Professor, Jerry went to the Mount Wilson Observatory, first as a
  Carnegie Fellow and later as a full staff member (1968-96). Up to his arrival
  at Mt. Wilson, Jerry's work had been largely theoretical, but his new
  environment, among observers and with large telescopes at his reach, quickly
  changed his interests to observational questions, as shown by some 40 entries
  in his bibliography for the late 1960's and early 1970's. Much of his work in
  this period was concerned with the optical identification of X-ray and radio
  sources, pulsars and quasars. As a result of this background and a general
  interest in extragalactic research, Kristian co-edited (with A. and M.
  Sandage), Volume IX,
    <cite>
      Galaxies and the Universe</cite>, of the compendium
    <cite>
      Stars and Stellar Systems</cite> (1975). A very important aspect of
      Jerry's activities in that period was his collaboration with James A.
      Westphal in experiments related to the use of S-T (silicon target) and SIT
      (intensified silicon target) detectors at the telescope. A number of
      pioneering discoveries, including evidence for super-massive objects in
      galactic nuclei, resulted from observations carried out with these and
      with CCD detectors (e.g., Young, Westphal, Kristian, Wilson, and Landauer,
      <em>ApJ</em> 221, 721, 1978). The great importance of the work on
      panoramic detectors by Westphal and Kristian becomes more apparent when it
      is considered that they were undertaken as part of planning for the Large
      Space Telescope beginning in 1974.</p>
  <p>After joining the Planetary Camera Team of the LST (later, of course, HST)
  with Westphal as Principal Investigator, Kristian became deeply involved in
  planning of future observations. He nevertheless maintained an active schedule
  of ground based observations, evidenced by his publications related to
  super-massive objects in the centers of galaxies and to gravitational lenses.
  A number of preliminary HST results in these two fields have been published
  with Kristian's participation, but undoubtedly many definitive publications in
  these and other fields were in preparation at the time of Jerry's untimely
  death. It should be expected that his HST team co-workers will keep his name
  in print for a long time to come.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, an anecdotal reference to Jerry's sense of humor will be
  recalled. Sometime in 1969, after I mentioned to him that one of my 18th
  century ancestors was a full blood Mayan Indian, he mentioned having Cherokee
  heritage, to which he traced his darkish complexion. At the time, I did not
  inquire further about the matter, but when I recently asked his son, John M.
  Kristian, whether he could verify this ancestry, he answered "He was pulling
  your leg when he spoke of being part Indian." John gave me a further example
  of Jerry's sense of humor which appears in his High School yearbook: he listed
  his hometown as "Brewburg" rather than Milwaukee.</p>
