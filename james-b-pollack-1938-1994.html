      <h1>James B. Pollack (1938-1994)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>James B. Pollack was born July 9,1938, in New York City. He died June 13,
  1994 of Chordoma, a rare form of cancer. His parents, Jeanne and Michael
  Pollack, ran a family clothing business, Pollack's, that had been in operation
  since the turn of the century. When Jim was very young, his parents and
  teachers worried that he might be retarded! Fortunately, according to his
  sister Ginny Breslauer of Woodmere, N.Y., a psychologist recognized that he
  thought so fast that his verbalization got in trouble trying to keep up! Jim
  taught himself to speak slowly to keep the words on track, and was, in fact, a
  slow speaker throughout his life (and impossible to interrupt). He became an
  avid young "rocket scientist" in the basement of his family home, was a track
  star and valedictorian for Lawrence High School, and Phi Beta Kappa at
  Princeton, where he graduated with High Honors in Physics. At Princeton, he
  was on the staff of "The Tiger" — the college humor magazine. Jim always
  enjoyed a good laugh, even at his own expense. In his 1987 Ames Fellow Award
  formal presentation dinner, he was soundly roasted by his colleagues in the
  Space Science Division, and loved every minute of it.</p>

  <p>After obtaining a Masters degree at Berkeley in nuclear physics, Jim went
  to Harvard to study Astronomy where he met Carl Sagan. Sagan realized Jim's
  talents immediately, calling him "bright and thoroughly imaginative, with keen
  physical insight and a significant ability to choose the most felicitous
  approaches to complex problems in mathematical physics". Sagan further noted
  that Jim " ... is interested in a wide variety of astronomical problems and
  has a significant capability for hard work." Even over thirty years, some
  things don't change! In 1970, Jim was lured to Ames by Ray Reynolds. Jim's
  work at Ames was quite diverse, and consisted of numerical modeling of
  planetary processes, planning and analysis of spacecraft data, and planning
  and interpreting observations from Ames' Kuiper Airbome Observatory. For
  example, he modeled KAO observations to determine the composition of the Venus
  clouds, the composition of Mars surface soils and atmospheric dust, and the
  size of the grains on Saturn's ring particles. He played key roles in nearly
  every NASA planetary mission since Apollo, including Mariner 9, Viking,
  Voyager, Pioneer Venus, Mars Observer, and Galileo. In all of his theoretical
  work, he blended extensive use of exact, numerically intensive techniques with
  intense flashes of "keen physical insight".</p>

  <p>With Ray Reynolds and other collaborators, Jim created the first detailed
  models of the early stages of formation of the giant gas planets. These models
  were the first to treat the forming planets like small stars, and to make
  accurate predictions as to the large amounts of energy they emitted as they
  collected infalling gas and solid material. Jim and his team used the models
  to explain the different compositions of the moons of Jupiter — the inner
  moons were too close to the hot, glowing gas spheres to allow icy material to
  freeze out and remain primarily rock to this day.</p>

  <p>Jim used these models to study the Saturn system as well; this work, and
  his deep understanding of scattering of radiation by wavelength-sized
  particles, led him to be the first to resolve a real puzzle posed by Saturn's
  rings. They gave off no radio wave emission, but were strong radar reflectors.
  Strange suggestions, such as metallic particles, were being advanced by
  others, but Jim realized that normal water ice particles could have this
  behavior if they were in the proper size range — centimeters to meters in
  size. He and Jeff Cuzzi refined these ideas into predictions that were
  confirmed by Voyager observations.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Jim and Bob Haberle developed the world's most complete
  model of Mars' atmospheric circulation. The model was used to interpret Viking
  spacecraft data and is also helping plan future missions to Mars by NASA as
  well as by the European and Russian space agencies. It has produced an
  understanding of the winds and pressure patterns seen by Viking, as well as
  leading towards explanations for the cause of the giant dust storms seen on
  Mars.</p>

  <p>Jim laid the foundation for the study of evolutionary climate change on all
  the terrestrial planets including Earth. This endeavor is so large in scope
  that only the outlines of its methodology are in place today; for example, Jim
  was the architect of two separate studies of Mars and Venus, still ongoing,
  that model the coupled evolution of the crust and atmosphere of a planet.
  These models, developed with Jim Kasting, include outgassing by the molten
  crust, atmospheric chemistry and radiative transfer, greenhouse effect, and
  reabsorption of atmospheric constituents in surface mineralogy.</p>

  <p>Jim's planetary perspective led him to make significant early contributions
  to the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere itself. With Brian Toon, Chris
  McKay, and other collaborators, he studied the effects on Earth's atmosphere
  and surface biology of the giant asteroid impact that led to the extinction of
  the dinosaurs, due to the insulating effect of the debris lofted into the
  atmosphere. This work led others, with Jim as collaborator, to the studies of
  "nuclear winter" which became influential to the national agenda on nuclear
  weapons. Jim also made important early contributions to our growing
  understanding that volcanoes can produce significant effects on the climate of
  the Earth.</p>

  <p>Jim's scientific quest always led him closer to the origin of the planets
  he studied, and of their atmospheres. In recent years, as astronomical
  observations began to return useful data on forming planetary systems possibly
  much like our own, his research had turned increasingly towards studies of the
  properties of planet-forming systems. With Pat Cassen, Bill Cabot, and others,
  he made use of state of the art computational fluid dynamical models on Ames
  supercomputers to study turbulent convection in gaseous protoplanetary disks.
  He also applied his radiative transfer expertise to determining the infrared
  and millimeter wavelength emission of their dusty gases.</p>

  <p>Pollack's broad perspective and highly creative interdisciplinary research
  brought him many awards. He won the prestigious Gerard P. Kuiper Prize of the
  Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society "for
  excellent and enduring contributions to planetary science". He was the
  co-recipient of the Leo Szilard Award of the American Physical Society for
  research in the public interest and an elected Fellow of the American
  Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
  and the American Astronautical Society. He won the Arthur S. Flemming Award,
  several NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and the Space
  Science Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for
  his work on planetary atmospheres, surfaces, and climate. He won Ames' H.
  Julian Allen award twice, and was elected both Ames Associate Fellow and Ames
  Fellow.</p>

  <p>Away from work, Jim enjoyed tennis and science fiction, and, although not
  fast, he was said to be a highly accurate shooter in basketball. He was an
  avid opera fan and a steady subscriber to the San Francisco opera. He brought
  to this avocation the same all embracing intellectual curiosity that he
  applied to his scientific pursuits. Thus, while he liked operas of every style
  and period, he was particularly attracted to those that were new or rarely
  performed, which gave him an opportunity to study new musical and historical
  contexts. Jim's longtime friend Bruce Hassell, who was his unfailing support
  during his illness, says Jim was especially fond of Wagner in any and all
  forms. Turandot, a story of suitors and riddles in an oriental setting, was a
  special favorite of Jim's. Susan Mead, another Ames opera buff, recalls that
  Jim would radiate sheer delight for days after seeing a good performance —
  which led some of his coworkers to name one of the local workstations
  "Tosca."</p>

  <p>All those who worked with Jim can testify to his encyclopedic grasp of
  properties and processes of importance to the origin, evolution, and current
  state of our solar system and others. We can also testify to his dogged
  persistence and unswerving devotion to answering the riddles of our solar
  system. We quickly learned that, if we couldn't explain an idea to Jim, we
  didn't understand it, and it was probably wrong. His penetrating questions
  were a familiar and recurrent feature at scientific meetings. He was, in
  Sagan's words, " … a gifted and inspiring teacher" and role model, mentoring
  dozens of scientists now doing leading research at Ames and around the world.
  His illness sapped his strength but didn't touch his intelligence or
  motivation, and he tirelessly continued working on the planning of future
  missions to Saturn, Mars, and Venus to the very end. He had many close,
  long-term friends, with whom he maintained lifelong relationships and whom he
  was never too busy to help out when needed. We at Ames, and in the scientific
  community, will miss him greatly.</p>
