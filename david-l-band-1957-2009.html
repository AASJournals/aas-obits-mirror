      <h1>David L. Band (1957-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>David L. Band, of Potomac Maryland, died on March 16, 2009 succumbing to a
  long battle with spinal cord cancer. His death at the age of 52 came as a
  shock to his many friends and colleagues in the physics and astronomy
  community.</p>

  <p>Band showed an early interest and exceptional aptitude for physics, leading
  to his acceptance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an
  undergraduate student in 1975. After graduating from MIT with an undergraduate
  degree in Physics, Band continued as a graduate student in Physics at Harvard
  University. His emerging interest in Astrophysics led him to the Astronomy
  Department at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), where he
  did his dissertation work with Jonathan Grindlay. His dissertation (1985)
  entitled “Non-thermal Radiation Mechanisms and Processes in SS433 and Active
  Galactic Nuclei” was “pioneering work on the physics of jets arising from
  black holes and models for their emission, including self-absorption, which
  previewed much to come, and even David’s own later work on Gamma-ray Bursts,”
  according to Grindlay who remained a personal friend and colleague of Band’s.
  Following graduate school, Band held postdoctoral positions at the Lawrence
  Livermore Laboratory, the University of California at Berkeley and the Center
  for Astronomy and Space Sciences at the University of California San Diego
  where he worked on the BATSE experiment that was part of the Compton Gamma Ray
  Observatory (CGRO), launched in 1991. BATSE had as its main objective the
  study of cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and made significant advances in this
  area of research. Band became a world-renowned figure in the emerging field of
  GRB studies. He is best known for his widely-used analytic form of gamma-ray
  burst spectra known as the “Band Function.”</p>

  <p>After the CGRO mission ended, Band moved to the Los Alamos National
  Laboratory where he worked mainly on classified research but continued to work
  on GRB energetics and spectra. When NASA planned two new follow-up missions to
  CGRO, the Swift and Fermi observatories, Band seized an opportunity in 2001 to
  join the staff of the Fermi Science Support Center at the NASA Goddard Space
  Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland. He was hired as the lead scientist for
  user support functions and to help to define and implement planning for the
  2008 launch of the Fermi spacecraft. He brought a high level of energy and
  enthusiasm to the job, becoming in many ways the heart and soul of that
  organization. Neil Gehrels, the Goddard Astroparticle Physics Division
  Director and a Fermi deputy project scientist notes that "David was the
  perfect person for community support, with this outgoing personality and deep
  knowledge of astrophysics." Band also became an important member of the Fermi
  science team; despite his failing health, he actively contributed to the first
  Fermi gamma-ray burst publication as well as making important contributions to
  the burst detection and data analysis techniques. Additionally, Band was known
  as a great communicator and mentor. He supervised a PhD student at UCSD who
  has subsequently been appointed to a faculty position. At Goddard, Band was an
  integral part of the weekly scientific discussion groups within the gamma-ray
  astronomy group and he would always find the time to share his knowledge and
  expertise with new postdoctoral fellows and senior scientists alike. He was
  also involved with planning the EXIST mission, a candidate for a future NASA
  mission. He will be greatly missed by his many friends and colleagues within
  the Fermi mission and the high-energy astrophysics community.</p>
