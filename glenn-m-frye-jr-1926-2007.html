      <h1>Glenn M. Frye, Jr. (1926-2007)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Glenn M. Frye, professor emeritus of physics at Case Western Reserve
  University, died in January 2007. His research interests at Case centered on
  the detection and identification of cosmic rays at the top of the
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Glenn was born in Michigan in 1926. He completed both his undergraduate and
  graduate studies at the University of Michigan. After earning his doctorate in
  1950, he joined the nuclear physics research staff at Los Alamos Scientific
  Laboratory. Frye’s research changed direction when he joined Fred Reines, who
  was also at LASL, in a cosmic ray experiment. In 1959, Reines moved east to
  become chair of the Case Institute of Technology physics department, and the
  following year Frye joined him there.</p>

  <p>The first years at Case Tech were devoted to the development of the rather
  complex spark chamber detectors which were destined to be suspended from high
  altitude balloons. Frye s experiments would be carried by the winds for
  hundreds of miles at altitudes greater than thirty miles, in both the northern
  and southern hemispheres. The maiden flights were launched in 1965 from the
  Palestine, Texas National Center for Atmospheric Research Balloon Base. The
  object was to search for gammas in the 30 to 500 MeV range coming from
  discrete point sources. Three years later the Frye team, along with
  collaborators from the University of Melbourne, reported success in this
  search. In a later Texas flight, high energy gammas were observed to come from
  the direction of the Crab Nebula, and, much more significantly, they arrived
  in the correct one millisecond bin of the known thirty millisecond period of
  the responsible pulsar.</p>

  <p>In later flights, involving ever more sophisticated detection schemes, Frye
  and his team collected valuable data on energetic gamma rays emitted by a
  dozen other sources. Through the 1970s and 1980s, they employed detectors with
  improved sensitivity and directionality to determine the energy distribution
  of cosmic gammas. With the participation of CWRU colleague Thomas Jenkins, the
  group undertook a series of experiments to determine the atmospheric gamma-ray
  spectrum from 50 MeV up to 12 GeV. The group subsequently developed spark
  chambers and time-of-flight electronics for the detection of neutrons from the
  sun and other sources. When opportunities for satellite-borne experiments
  became available, Frye and Jenkins joined in an experiment aboard the Compton
  Gamma-ray Observatory Satellite.</p>

  <p>Until his retirement in 1993, Glenn Frye found a way to do exciting physics
  and astrophysics which involved travel and adventure, world-class research,
  and great opportunities for his students and colleagues.</p>
