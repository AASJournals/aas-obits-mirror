  <p>Professor Per Maltby, prominent Norwegian Solar Physicist at the Institute
  of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo, Norway, died on 24 May 2006.
  Lung cancer was diagnosed in February, but he was expected to improve. Until
  the end of March he came to his office every day, got recent papers off the
  web, and followed his field closely as he had always done.</p>

  <p>Per Maltby was born in Oslo, Norway, on 3 November 1933. He started his
  studies at the University of Oslo in 1952 and took his candidate degree in
  1957. Between 1955 and 1958 he was a research assistant at the Institute of
  Theoretical Astrophysics in Oslo. In 1960 Maltby became an assistant professor
  (amanuensis) at the University of Bergen and from January 1963 he held a
  corresponding position at the University of Oslo. He became an associate
  professor in 1967, and from 1983 until he retired in 2003 he was a full
  Professor at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of
  Oslo.</p>

  <p>Per Maltby is survived by his wife Elisabet (née Ruud), whom he married in
  1956. They had two children. The daughter, Bente, is a medical doctor and
  gynecologist serving as a section head at the district hospital in
  Kristiansand in southern Norway. Their son, Lars, holds a doctoral degree in
  engineering, specializing in the properties of powders. He is currently
  managing director in the Norwegian division of the French multinational
  company Saint Gobain. As a father Per Maltby expressed pride in his children
  and was pleased with their progress in life. He also enjoyed his five
  grandchildren.</p>

  <p>As a scientist, Per Maltby was versatile and productive. In the early 1960s
  he visited the California Institute of Technology where he did pioneering
  studies of the distribution and time variation of the radio emission from
  active galaxies, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. His work with Alan
  Moffet contributed to revealing the secrets of these remote objects. Their
  results drew attention and were indeed mentioned in the pages of Time
  magazine.</p>

  <p>However, Maltby's lifelong interest was in our Sun, and most of his more
  than 200 published articles and presentations are within the field of solar
  physics. Throughout his career, and into his years as an emeritus professor,
  he obtained significant results, results to which colleagues all over the
  world will continue to refer.</p>

  <p>In 1964 Maltby took his doctoral degree (Doctor Philosopiae) on a study of
  the Evershed effect. He elegantly demonstrated that the flow was predominantly
  radial with only minor vertical and azimuthal components and that flow speeds
  increased all the way to the edge of the penumbra where the flow seemed to
  abruptly disappear. This disagreed with conventional knowledge at the time.
  His results are, however, confirmed in all later investigations.</p>

  <p>Per Maltby highly valued his work with colleague Gunnar Eriksen. They
  studied the effect of progressive sonic and Alfvén waves on the profiles of
  spectral lines. The results demonstrated the characteristic spectral
  signatures of such waves and laid the foundation for a proper use of line
  profiles as a diagnostic tool for waves in solar and stellar atmospheres.</p>

  <p>Sunspots continued to be a main interest. For twenty years Per Maltby and
  his students measured the relative intensity of sunspots at a number of
  wavelengths from blue and into the infrared. The infrared measurements
  represented entirely new knowledge, giving access to the deepest layers in the
  sunspot photospheres. This refined series of spectral sunspot measurements
  stretched over two eleven-year activity cycles and resulted in his models of
  the umbra and penumbra of spots, models that have served as standard reference
  models until this day.</p>

  <p>Already before the start of the SOHO era in solar physics, Per Maltby had
  shifted his attention to the conditions in the transition region and coronal
  layers above sunspots. Together with his collaborators he studied rapid down
  flows, often at supersonic speeds, from the corona into sunspot umbrae. He
  rediscovered sunspot plumes, the dense, cold pillars of gas rising above
  sunspot umbrae and penumbrae into the corona, and mapped their properties.</p>

  <p>In his last works Maltby unambiguously showed that the transition region
  over sunspot umbrae were filled with upward propagating sound waves that
  penetrate into the corona under certain conditions. This result deserves
  special attention since many have believed that such penetrations must take
  place, but nobody was earlier able to demonstrate it observationally in a
  convincing manner.</p>

  <p>Per Maltby was always looking forward and always aware of new
  possibilities. He was an influential member on the Norwegian government
  committee that recommended Norwegian membership in the European Space Agency
  (ESA), and was the force behind securing sufficient domestic government funds
  to allow Norwegian scientists to participate in SOHO and Cluster. He took part
  in SOHO from the earliest planning stages and later played a prominent role in
  the Norwegian SOHO project. Through his activities, Norwegian space research
  came to life, introducing new and rich possibilities for research in astronomy
  and geophysics in Norway.</p>

  <p>Maltby played important roles in many national and international advisory
  groups and committees. For a number of years he was a member of several of
  ESA's advisory groups. He served as leader of the Institute of Theoretical
  Astrophysics in Oslo in 1976-1977, and in 1976-1981 he was a member, and later
  the chairman, of the project selection committee for natural sciences for the
  Norwegian Foundation of Science and the Humanities. Finally, Maltby was
  instrumental in securing a Norwegian role in the Japanese solar space
  observatory Hinode, which will be a rich source for Norwegian solar physics in
  the years to come.</p>

  <p>Per Maltby had a remarkably wide scientific orientation. His papers most
  frequently describe observations and their interpretation. He had an enormous
  respect for what is "real," the solid and measurable. But he combined this
  with deep theoretical insights that he demonstrated in his interpretations and
  theoretical papers.</p>

  <p>Per taught his students a rational, scientific way of thinking and
  encouraged their curiosity. He was open and always dedicated to develop the
  best scientific cooperation. And he was generous, which was always important
  to his young collaborators. He might appear quiet and reserved, but showed his
  warm heart and appreciation when you got close to him. His death is a sad loss
  for his colleagues and for our discipline.</p>
