<div>
  <p>Dr. Herbert Gursky, Acting Associate Director of Research for the Naval
  Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Systems Directorate, and formerly Superintendent
  of the Space Science Division and Chief Scientist of the E. O. Hulburt Center
  for Space Research. Dr. Gursky died following a long illness on late Friday
  afternoon, December 1, 2006. Dr. Gursky was a great friend, valued colleague,
  and distinguished researcher who will be missed greatly.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gursky was born in Bronx, New York, on May 27, 1930. He was educated in
  secondary schools in Miami, Florida, and received a Bachelor's Degree from the
  University of Florida in 1951. He did graduate work in physics at Vanderbilt
  University (Master's degree in 1953) and Princeton University (Doctorate
  degree in 1959). His first professional position was at Columbia University as
  an instructor in the Physics Department from 1958 to 1961.</p>

  <p>In 1961, he joined American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&amp;E) in
  Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a senior scientist and rose to the position of
  Vice President, Space Research in 1967. In 1973 he joined the Smithsonian
  Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) as a supervisory astrophysicist. In 1974, Dr.
  Gursky was appointed Professor in the Practice of Astronomy at Harvard
  University and in 1976 was named Associate Director of the Center for
  Astrophysics for the Division of Optical and Infrared Astronomy. In 1981, Dr.
  Gursky joined NRL as Superintendent of its Space Science Division and Chief
  Scientist of the E. O. Hulburt Center for Space Research. He moved to the
  position of Acting Associate Director of Research for NRL's Systems
  Directorate in 2006.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gursky's primary research interests were in the area of X-ray
  astronomy. He published more than 100 articles in this area and edited two
  books on the subject. Before arriving at NRL, he was the principal
  investigator for NASA-sponsored space programs on the Astronomical Netherlands
  Satellite (ANS) and the High Energy Astrophysics Observatory (HEAO)-1
  satellite, and a co-investigator on numerous other rocket and satellite
  experiments.</p>

  <p>At AS&amp;E, Dr. Gursky managed research activities encompassing solar
  physics and magnetospheric research, and at SAO, he managed programs of
  ground-based astronomy and infrared astronomy. At SAO, he oversaw the
  completion of the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint program of SAO and the
  University of Arizona, comprising a 4.5-meter (equivalent) telescope of novel
  design that is situated at Mount Hopkins in Arizona.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gursky's work at NRL involved direction of a broad-ranging research
  effort involving about fifty Ph.D. scientists conducting investigations in the
  areas of high-energy astronomy, solar physics, solar terrestrial effects and
  atmospheric science. NRL is the corporate research laboratory for the Navy and
  has the responsibility for assuring that future Navy systems take full
  advantage of all available technology and scientific understandings.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gursky had the ability to distill and seize the most important nuggets
  from any research program and envision its application to a variety of new
  problems and directions. In numerous areas of atmospheric, solar and space
  science technology, Dr. Gursky recognized key scientific issues and their
  potential DoD applications.</p>

  <p>In solar physics, he spurred the development of semi-empirical modeling to
  predict solar storms that has been successfully transitioned to operational
  systems. He also supported participation in all NASA and other agency
  Sun-Earth connection orbiting space programs which resulted in a succession of
  spectacularly successful experiments in solar physics such as the high
  resolution rocket spectrograph and its flight on the NASA Spacelab 2, the
  Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) on the NASA Upper
  Atmosphere Research Satellite, the Bragg crystal spectrometer solar flare
  experiment on the Japanese Yohkoh spacecraft, and the Large Angle and
  Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) and extreme ultraviolet imaging
  telescope (EIT) on the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These
  experiments have shed considerable light on how solar activity affects the
  near-Earth environment with many potential space weather applications.</p>

  <p>In high-energy astronomy, Dr. Gursky made many contributions. He provided
  scientific oversight for the Advanced Research and Global Observation
  Satellite (ARGOS) Space Test Program spacecraft that contained five NRL
  instruments: the Unconventional Stellar Aspect (USA) experiment, the Global
  Imaging Monitor of the Ionosphere (GIMI), the High Resolution Airglow/Aurora
  Spectroscopy (HIRAAS) experiment, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Photometer
  (EUVIP), and the Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography (CERTO)
  instrument.</p>

  <p>He continued his interest in X-ray astronomy with the USA experiment, which
  obtained observations of many celestial sources such as galactic binary X-ray
  sources and pulsars. Always with an eye toward applications, Dr. Gursky was
  interested in using X-ray sources, specifically X-ray pulsars, as precise
  clocks to provide spacecraft with autonomous timing and navigation. Dr. Gursky
  also supported research in gamma ray astrophysics, such as the development of
  NRL's Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE) for the NASA
  Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) satellite, and analysis of solar flare
  gamma ray spectra obtained from the NASA Solar Maximum Mission.</p>

  <p>In atmospheric science, Dr. Gursky particularly encouraged practical
  applications of basic research. He recognized the importance of remote sensing
  for space weather, which resulted in the development at NRL of operational
  ultraviolet sensors on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
  spacecraft that are now providing environmental data products to the Air Force
  Space Weather Agency. He initiated a program in middle atmosphere research
  that has been enormously successful and has spawned numerous experimental and
  theoretical advances, such as the Middle Atmosphere High Resolution
  Spectrograph Investigation (MAHRSI) to measure trace constituents in the
  middle atmosphere such as the hydroxyl radical (OH). Dr. Gursky supported the
  development of theoretical middle atmosphere models such as the Mountain Wave
  Forecast Model that was used to predict flight conditions for allied aircraft
  during operations Southern Watch, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom, which
  has been a boon to stratospheric flight operations over mountainous terrain.
  He also supported the HIRAAS experiment on ARGOS.</p>

  <p>Dr. Gursky provided outstanding leadership in the continued development of
  the United States space program. Under his stewardship, the NRL Space Science
  Division substantially expanded its leadership role in understanding the space
  environment and its effects on military and civilian systems. The Laboratory
  and the world are now witnessing the newest results of his scientific acumen
  and sound decision-making as exemplified in the very recent successful
  completions and launches of these major Space Science Division
  instruments:</p>

  <p>Delivery of GLAST LAT (September 2006): Delivery of the collaborative NRL
  Large Area Telescope (LAT) for the NASA Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope
  (GLAST) satellite integration; when deployed, GLAST will measure the most
  energetic processes in the universe — from X-ray bursts, black holes, neutron
  stars, and solar flares — and has the potential to discover previously unknown
  relics of the Big Bang;</p>

  <p>Launch of SOLAR-B (September 2006): The Japan Aerospace Exploration
  Agency's Hinode (Japanese for Sunrise, formerly known as SOLAR-B) launched
  September 23 carrying NRL's collaborative Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging
  Spectrometer (EIS), which achieved first light on October 28. EIS is now
  observing emission lines produced by highly ionized elements in the solar
  coronal and upper transition region of the Sun's atmosphere. Space Science
  Division scientists expect much exciting science concerning the coupling of
  solar activity to the near-Earth space environment to be produced by the EIS
  instrument; and,</p>

  <p>Launch of STEREO (October 2006): NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations
  Observatory (STEREO) launched 25 October, carrying the collaborative NRL
  Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)
  instruments suite, which is currently successfully functioning in the
  pre-commissioning phase. The instruments onboard STEREO's twin spacecraft will
  make observations to help NRL researchers construct the first-ever
  three-dimensional views of coronal mass ejections, vital data — in complement
  with the long-operational NRL-built NASA LASCO — for understanding how the Sun
  creates space weather</p>

  <p>Perhaps Dr. Gursky's most personal research successes were as a member of
  the group that made the discovery of cosmic X-ray sources in 1961, his work
  with sounding rockets that culminated in the optical identification of the
  bright X-ray source Scorpius X1 in 1966, his work on clusters of galaxies and
  the diffuse X-ray background from the Uhuru Satellite and the discovery of
  X-ray bursters on the ANS satellite.</p>
