      <h1>Arthur Adel (1908-1994)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Arthur Adel died of cancer, September 13, 1994 in Flagstaff, AZ, at age 85.
  Art was born of immigrant parents November 22, 1908 in Brooklyn, NY, and when
  they moved to Detroit, he graduated from a technical high school, learning the
  mechanical arts that later sustained him as one of the country's leading
  experimental astrophysicists.</p>

  <p>At the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, he received a Bachelor's degree
  for a double major in mathematics and physics, and received vital
  assistantships and fellowships from the university during the depression
  years. He repaid these trusts throughout his life with scholastic achievement
  and a loyalty to the university that extended far beyond his Ph.D., awarded in
  1933. His theoretical dissertation, "The Infrared Spectrum and the Structure
  of the Carbon Dioxide Molecule," together with a sound background in
  experimentation and instrumentation, equipped him with guidelines and
  framework for his later experimental investigations.</p>

  <p>In 1933, Art Adel's mentor, Harrison M. Randall, chairman of the Physics
  department, authorized him to work jointly with the university and Lowell
  Observatory. It was a major turning point in his career. Earlier, Rupert Wildt
  had discovered the presence of ammonia and methane in the atmospheres of the
  major planets. Adel, using Slipher's spectra, was able to show that the
  absorption bands were due to harmonics of the fundamental vibrations of the
  methane and ammonia molecules.</p>

  <p>Art had to do one of two things, calculate all possible harmonics of the
  fundamental vibrations of methane, or photograph the methane spectrum at
  atmospheric depths where these harmonics would manifest. He did both! This
  work was described in a series of papers between 1934 and 1935, appearing in
  <em>Nature</em> <strong>134</strong>, p. 148; <em>Physics Rev.</em>
  <strong>46</strong>, pp. 240,902; <strong>47</strong>, pp. 651, and 787. Henry
  Norris Russell commented, "The proof by Adel ... is as beautiful an
  application of spectroscopic theory as one could desire to see." (Russell,
  H.N., <em>M.N.R.A.S.</em>, <strong>95</strong>, 610, 1935).</p>

  <p>While living in Ann Arbor Dr. Adel met Catherine Backus, a student majoring
  in mathematics and French. He and Catherine were married in 1935.</p>

  <p>In the 1935-36 academic year, he took a leave of absence from Lowell
  Observatory and was a post-doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University. He
  taught evening classes in astronomy and worked with Gerhard Dieke on the
  hydrogen spectrum. Some of his fondest memories there were times spent with
  the distinguished experimental physicist, A.H. Pfund.</p>

  <p>The Adels moved to Flagstaff in 1936 for residence at Lowell Observatory.
  The high and dry climate of Flagstaff became a major element in Art's
  successful study of the water vapor related parameters in the earth's
  atmosphere. His accomplishments during the years at Lowell are recorded in
  over fifty publications. For the listing below, I am grateful to have a
  history prepared by Monica A. Joseph, Boston University 1976, entitled, "The
  Contribution of Arthur Adel To Astronomical Infrared Spectroscopy."</p>

  <p>Some of the major results include: (a.) the first precise definition and
  delineation of the rock-salt prismatic solar-telluric spectrum for 5 microns
  to 13.9 microns; (b.) the discovery of atmospheric nitrous oxide, the now
  widely accepted explanation that the origin of atmospheric nitrous oxide comes
  from the soil and oceans of the earth and the importance of this process as
  part of the Nitrogen Cycle; (c.) the discovery of atmospheric heavy
  water-vapor, HDO; (d.) atmospheric transmission as a function of water-vapor
  content from 5 to 14 microns; (e.) observations and preparation of the first
  grating map of the solar-telluric spectrum; (f.) the discovery of the 20
  micron window in the earth's atmosphere; (g.) and the first definitive
  emission spectrum of the moon, with evidence that it radiates as a simple
  black body.</p>

  <p>In 1942 Adel joined the war effort and did research for the Navy. From
  1942-46, he taught physics at the University of Michigan, and during 1946-48
  was assistant professor of astronomy at the McMath-Hulburt Solar
  Observatory.</p>

  <p>While at Michigan he worked under a government contract to establish an
  infrared laboratory at Hollomon Air Force Base (Alamogordo, NM). While there,
  he investigated radar's failure to deliver energy at specific wavelengths. Van
  Vleck, Uhlenbeck, and Dennison suggested the intrinsic width of a water vapor
  line might cause the problem. Art reworked all his equipment, installed a new
  grating and the exceedingly narrow bandpass was measured. He solved the
  problem.</p>

  <p>In 1948 Adel accepted a professorship at Arizona State College, now
  Northern Arizona University (NAU), Flagstaff, AZ, where he taught mathematics
  and continued his atmospheric infrared research.</p>

  <p>With an Air Force contract he established the Atmospheric Research
  Observatory on campus, in order to continue his study of atmospheric ozone. A
  24-inch reflector was equipped with a rock-salt prism monochromator, and a
  prism-grating monochromator was fed from a 16-inch coelostat. Observations
  began in 1952 and continued into the next decade. With E.S. Epstein, Adel
  determined the vertical atmospheric ozone distributions from absorptions and
  radiation by ozone. During their ozone research, they discovered ten and
  eighteen day temperature periodicities in the stratosphere and a corresponding
  eighteen day period in the troposphere.</p>

  <p>Dr. Arthur Adel retired as professor emeritus in May 1976, and in 1982 the
  NAU mathematics building was named in his honor. He was very proud of his
  students and one informed me Adel inspired them to pursue advanced degrees,
  and watched over them with guiding care.</p>

  <p>He was a co-founder and first president of the NAU's chapter of Sigma Xi,
  he was elected in 1970 to honorary membership in Sigma Pi Sigma (the national
  physics honor society), and was a fellow of the American Physical Society and
  the Arizona Academy of Science. In 1977 he was named a Fellow of the Explorers
  Club, and the following year he was elected to the Johns Hopkins University
  Society of Scholars. He received a certificate from the American Astronomical
  Society acknowledging his fifty years of membership in 1994.</p>

  <p>A few weeks before his death we talked about the Comet Shoemaker-Levy
  impact with the planet Jupiter. He told me that in the 1930's he had mentioned
  to V.M. Slipher that the large white spots on Saturn might be cometary
  impacts. He was amused, in his impish way, that the excitement we experienced
  during the SL-9 impact, has been available to astronomers and the public for
  decades.</p>

  <p>In retirement, Art took fastidious care of Catherine, his love of sixty
  years. He attended many of the numerous scientific functions and lecture
  series held in the Flagstaff community. Visitors were always impressed with
  the questions from the dapper, gentle man with impeccable manners. Art's
  persistent probing mind was a stimulation to his students, colleagues and vast
  number of friends. We miss him.</p>
