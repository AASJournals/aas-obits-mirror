      <h1>Lynne Karen Deutsch (1956-2004)</h1>

<div>
  <p>It is with deep sadness and regret that we note the passing of our dear
  friend and colleague Prof. Lynne K. Deutsch. Lynne died on 2 April 2004 after
  a protracted illness and lengthy battle with complications caused by the blood
  disease Polycythaemia Vera.</p>

  <p>Lynne was born in Chicago on 26 November 1956 to Victor and Ailsa Deutsch.
  She lived with her family in the town of Morton Grove, IL until she was 8
  years old, when they moved to Beverly Hills, CA. She was an outgoing child who
  played basketball and excelled in her studies. She graduated from Beverly
  Hills High School at the age of 16 after completing all high school
  requirements in only three years. Lynne had a beautiful singing voice, and was
  in the chorus in high school and college.</p>

  <p>Lynne earned her first bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University
  of California at Berkeley in 1977. She then returned to Berkeley and received
  a second bachelor's degree, this time in physics, in 1981. She was a graduate
  student and teaching assistant at MIT and earned an MS in physics from MIT in
  1983. Lynne then attended the astronomy graduate program at Harvard
  University, where she earned her MA in 1985 and PhD in 1990. During her degree
  studies she began crafting mid-infrared instrumentation. These instruments
  were destined to be used by a host of eager observers to discover, identify,
  and study many emissions from the Solar System, and galactic and extragalactic
  sources.</p>

  <p>Lynne was a National Research Council Post-doctoral Fellow at NASA Ames
  Research Center from 1990 - 1992, where she played an important role in the
  development of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory/University of Arizona
  Mid-Infrared Array Camera (MIRAC), a well-known and much sought after
  instrument frequently used in studies of Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, planetary
  nebulae, star formation regions, galactic center, young stellar objects, and
  extragalactic objects.</p>

  <p>After leaving NASA Ames Research Center, Lynne taught for several years
  (1993-96) at Smith College where she had a significant impact on undergraduate
  research, especially for women, whom she enjoyed mentoring. Lynne joined the
  faculty in the Astronomy Department of Boston University in 1996 where she
  taught instrumentation principles and techniques to undergraduate and graduate
  students. Over the course of her faculty career, she received numerous
  research grants and fellowships that were used to support her research, her
  students, and her postdoctoral associates. She was the principal investigator
  of Boston University's advanced technologies and instrumentation program
  MIRABU: A Mid-Infrared Array.</p>

  <p>As her health declined and the rigors of a full teaching schedule became
  unacceptably taxing, Lynne took a leave of absence from Boston University and
  returned to Harvard University and the Center for Astrophysics in 2001. There
  she became a very active member of the Infrared Group in the OIR Division and
  a member of the IRAC/Spitzer Space Telescope team. Her research in infrared
  astronomy covered many areas including star formation, planetary and
  protoplanetary nebulae, solar system objects, the interstellar medium and
  infrared-luminous galaxies. Her most recent research with the Infrared Array
  Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope concentrated on high-mass star
  formation and the related evolution of the interstellar medium. In her short
  life, Lynne made many devoted friends and colleagues and was active in
  encouraging school-age girls to pursue their interests in the sciences. In her
  short career, she published more than seventy-five articles. She was an
  outstanding observer and instrumentalist, whose promising career was
  tragically cut short.</p>

  <p>Lynne was also a devoted mother and wife, and, while still well, she found
  the time to be an active participant in her son's elementary school. She is
  very greatly missed by her family. She is survived by her husband Douglas
  Sondak, PhD and her son Reed Deutsch-Sondak who live in Acton, MA, and her
  parents and sister Judith who reside in California.</p>

  <p>Lynne will be forever missed by her family, friends, colleagues, and the
  astronomical community. Her contributions will continue to benefit the
  community for many years to come. We only wish she were here to share them
  with us. She will be remembered as a dear friend, colleague, accomplished
  scientist, and dedicated family member.</p>
