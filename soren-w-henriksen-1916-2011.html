      <h1>Soren W. Henriksen (1916-2011)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Soren Werner Henriksen, one of the first to apply space age data to the
  mapping sciences, died September 5, 2011, at the age of 95. He was a polymath
  in the fields of geodesy, surveying, photogrammetry, cartography, and
  astronomy, his culminating achievement being “Glossary of the Mapping
  Sciences,” a 581 page compendium published in 1994.</p>

  <p>Soren was born in New York, New York, on August 5, 1916, and grew up in
  Chicago, Illinois. In 1938 he joined the Illinois National Guard, and
  transferred in 1941 to the U. S. Army. He served until August 1945, after
  being severely wounded in the Philippines that summer. He entered the Illinois
  Institute of Technology next year, earning a Bachelor’s degree in 1949 in
  mathematics. A Master’s degree from the University of Illinois in 1950,
  continuing in mathematics, followed.</p>

  <p>The U. S. Army Map Service (AMS), a component of the Army Corps of
  Engineers, was actively recruiting mathematicians at that time. The exigencies
  of the Cold War required improvements in knowledge of the figure of the Earth,
  intercontinental connections, and the Earth's gravity field. Soren joined AMS
  in 1951 and was assigned to the Occultation Section of the Research and
  Analysis Branch in the Geodetic Division. This was his fortuitous introduction
  to professional astronomy. He was lucky to have a first-rate mentor in John
  O'Keefe (BAAS, 2000. 32, 1683), the head of the Branch, whose expertise lay in
  the application of astronomical methods for position determination, in
  particular, lunar occultations and solar eclipses. Soren rapidly applied his
  mathematical skills to this area, and in 1955 was promoted to Chief of the
  Section. In addition to his operational duties of analyzing and reducing
  observational data, he authored the definitive manual on the subject: "The
  Application of Occultations to Geodesy," published as AMS Technical Report 46
  in 1962.</p>

  <p>Well before the first artificial satellite launch in 1957 O'Keefe had
  realized the tremendous advantage of observations from this source for geodesy
  and laid the ground-work for their utilization at AMS. Soren turned the
  attention of his Section to the development of satellite observing systems. He
  was largely responsible for the employment of Minitrack II and SECOR, mobile
  satellite tracking systems that could be readily shifted from one set of sites
  to another.</p>

  <p>In 1960 he was promoted to Chief of Research and Analysis. The
  administrative and supervisory duties this entailed limited his opportunities
  for individual research, and at the beginning of 1965 he left for a position
  at Raytheon Autometric where he was able to apply his experience in satellite
  data analysis to the demands of various contractors. A typical contract report
  of this period coauthored by him was "Modes of Satellite Triangulation
  Adjustment." During his seven years at Autometric he received its Outstanding
  Author Award twice.</p>

  <p>He helped organize the Third International Symposium on the Use of
  Artificial Satellites for Geodesy held in Washington, D. C., in April 1971,
  and coedited the proceedings, published as Geophysical Monograph 15 by the
  American Geophysical Union (AGU). Based on this accomplishment, in 1972 AGU
  asked him to serve as editor for a collection of articles covering NASA's
  National Geodetic Satellite Project. This turned out to be a two year task,
  during which Soren carried the load of assembling the 1030 page, two volume,
  compilation. After completion Soren returned to the Federal government as a
  research geodesist in the Geodetic Research and Development Laboratory at NOAA
  in 1974.</p>

  <p>His work there covered a variety of topics including determination of polar
  motion, utilization of geoceiver observations, and photogrammetric
  applications. He applied his editorial skills to the 1980 edition of the
  "Manual of Photogrammetry" as an associate editor, and authored the entry on
  field surveys for photogrammetry. But the major efforts of his ten year stint
  at NOAA were devoted to the preparation of a glossary to supplant the classic
  “Definition of Terms Used in Geodetic and Other Surveys” by Hugh Mitchell
  published in 1948. Soren envisaged not just a revision and update, but a
  vastly increased encyclopedic dictionary, encompassing in addition to geodesy
  and surveying the related fields of cartography, map production,
  photogrammetry, and remote sensing. This ambitious scheme proved to be
  controversial, and the resulting publication "Geodetic Glossary", issued in
  1986 by the National Geodetic Survey of NOAA, omitted many of the entries not
  directly related to geodesy.</p>

  <p>Before then, Soren decided to leave and continue work on his own version.
  He took advantage of his eligibility for retirement in 1984, and in 1988
  submitted his manuscript to a joint committee of the American Society of
  Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS), the American Congress of Surveying
  and Mapping, and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). Publication
  followed under the auspices of ASCE.</p>

  <p>Soren participated actively in the life of several professional societies.
  He was a member of AGU, ASPRS, Institute of Electrical and Electronic
  Engineers, Royal Astronomical Society, and American Astronomical Society.</p>

  <p>A prominent trait of Soren's was his competitiveness, both in and outside
  of his profession. Two of his favorite forms of recreation were duplicate
  bridge and the ancient Chinese board game, Go. After age limited his mobility,
  he turned to the challenge of computer games like Myst. He retained an
  interest in updating his glossary to the end. He is survived by his wife of 59
  years, Pamelia, a daughter, Kirsten, and two grandchildren. A son, Donn,
  predeceased him.</p>
