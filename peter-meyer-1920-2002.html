  <p>Peter Meyer, a distinguished astrophysicist and pioneer in cosmic-ray
  observations, died in Chicago on 7 March 2002, after a stroke, following long
  illness. He was born in Berlin, Germany, on 6 January 1920, the son of Franz
  Julius Meyer, a Jewish physician, and Frida Luise (née Lehmann) Meyer, a
  nurse. Peter received his initial academic training at the Technical
  University in Berlin, with the famous physicist Hans Geiger as one of his
  teachers. He received a degree as Diplom Ingenieur in 1942 with a thesis on
  proportional counters. Because of his partial Jewish heritage, he was
  permitted neither to continue his studies towards a PhD, nor to have the
  “honor” of serving in the war. He survived as a factory worker, and after the
  war, enrolled at the University of Göttingen. With Wolfgang Paul (Nobel Prize
  in Physics, 1989) and Hans Kopfermann as his advisors, Peter received a PhD in
  physics in 1948, with a thesis on the precise measurement of the binding
  energy of the deuteron. He continued research in experimental nuclear physics
  in Göttingen, and as a post-doctoral fellow at the Cavendish Laboratory in
  Cambridge. From 1950 to 1953, Peter was a staff scientist at the Max Planck
  Institute for Physics at Göttingen.</p>

  <p>In 1953, Peter came to the U.S. and became a Research Associate of John
  Simpson at the Institute for Nuclear Studies (now the Enrico Fermi Institute)
  of the University of Chicago. He remained associated with this University for
  the rest of his life, although he accepted invitations for a number of
  extended research visits at the Max Planck Institutes in Garching and
  Heidelberg. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at Chicago in
  1956, promoted to Associate Professor in 1962, and to Professor in 1966. Peter
  served as Director of the Enrico Fermi Institute from 1978 to 1983, and as
  Chairman of the Department of Physics from 1986 to 1989. In 1990, he became
  Professor Emeritus.</p>

  <p>As cosmic rays were a challenging topic at the intersection of nuclear
  physics, astrophysics, and emerging particle physics, Peter became interested
  in this subject during his early career in Göttingen, and contributed to the
  classic collection of review articles on cosmic radiation edited by Heisenberg
  in 1953. After coming to Chicago, cosmic ray studies remained at the center of
  his research until the end of his career.</p>

  <p>Together with John Simpson,
  Peter conducted a number of measurements with instrumentation on balloons or
  on aircraft, to investigate the then mysterious variations of cosmic rays with
  time and with geographic location. It was not clear which of these variations
  were of solar origin, or intrinsic to the galactic radiation, or just due to
  phenomena in the earth’s magnetic field and ionosphere. Important insight came
  from observations of a gigantic solar flare in 1956 which Simpson, Meyer, and
  Eugene Parker could only explain by assuming that interplanetary space is
  filled with plasma and varying magnetic field, strongly affected by solar
  activity. This idea led, subsequently, to the concept of the solar wind.</p>

  <p>Peter also collaborated with Simpson on the design of some of the first
  cosmic-ray detectors flown in space. In parallel with this work, he started a
  research program that would lead to a long series of ever more complex cosmic
  ray detectors carried by giant stratospheric balloons. First, he tried to
  detect electrons in the cosmic rays. Their existence was inferred from
  observations of non-thermal radio emission from the galaxy, but was never
  proven directly, and the experimental obstacles were formidable. Peter,
  together with his graduate student Rochus Vogt, devised a new and completely
  electronic instrument, and succeeded in 1961, at about the same time that
  James Earl of the University of Minnesota reported the observation of
  electrons with balloon-borne cloud chambers. Electrons and positrons can be
  produced in about equal proportions by collision of protons with interstellar
  gas. The obvious question was then: Is there an excess of negative electrons
  that would indicate that electrons are also accelerated in primary cosmic ray
  sources? To test this, Peter, together with colleague Roger Hildebrand and
  graduate students Jack Fanselow and Robert Hartman, built the first magnet
  spectrometer flown on balloons, and could report in 1964 that, indeed, the
  negative electrons significantly outnumbered the positrons.</p>

  <p>Detailed observations of cosmic-ray electrons, including electrons of solar
  origin or those accelerated in Jupiter’s magnetosphere, occupied Peter and his
  group (including Jacques L’Heureux, Dietrich Hovestadt, and Paul Evenson) for
  the next two decades, using a variety of instruments, on balloons and in
  space.</p>

  <p>In the 1970’s, Peter directed his attention towards measurements of the
  nuclear composition of cosmic rays at very high energies. To this end, new
  particle identification techniques, such as gas Cherenkov counters, were
  applied, and with colleague Dietrich Müller and graduate student Einar
  Juliusson, Peter discovered that the relative intensity of secondary
  cosmic-ray nuclei produced by spallation of primaries in interstellar space,
  decreases continuously with increasing energy, as if the parent primary
  particle traversed a smaller and smaller galactic path length at higher
  energies. A similar observation was also made by Luis Alvarez’ group at
  Berkeley at about the same time. As a consequence of this unexpected
  phenomenon, cosmic rays must be generated at their sources at a higher rate at
  high energy than the observed spectrum at Earth would imply: the energy
  spectrum emitted at the sources must be harder than that observed here. In the
  late 1970’s, theorists finally proposed the first-order Fermi acceleration
  process in supernova shockfronts as an efficient mechanism to generate cosmic
  rays. This process predicted a hard-source energy spectrum for which the
  Chicago measurements provided the ready evidence.</p>

  <p>Eventually, these studies led to a very large instrument, dubbed the
  “Chicago egg”, that flew on the Space Shuttle in 1985. This detector was
  designed by Meyer and Müller, who were later joined by L’Heureux and Simon
  Swordy. It used, for the first time, transition radiation detectors to measure
  the energy of cosmic-ray nuclei. With this instrument, details of the
  elemental composition of cosmic rays could be measured well into the
  TeV-region of energies.</p>

  <p>Peter was convinced that observational progress is tightly coupled to
  experimental finesse. Throughout his career, he received joy and satisfaction
  from implementing new experimental techniques. He led a sizeable group of
  postdocs, technicians, and students who shared this conviction, respected his
  leadership and accepted Peter as a mentor in many aspects of their lives, not
  just the technical and scientific questions of research.</p>

  <p>Peter was a principled man. He was modest, reliable, and dependable. He was
  very well read in classical and modern literature. His life was disciplined
  and structured, but had many facets. The workday belonged to the laboratory,
  but evenings were reserved for the family, and for his most serious passion,
  music. Peter was an accomplished cellist, and together with his first wife,
  Luise Schützmeister Meyer, who played the piano, he arranged for regular
  chamber music evenings in his home, which are fondly remembered by all who had
  the privilege of being invited to listen. Some remember in awe how Peter was
  able to combine smoking the pipe with playing the cello! Both Peter and Luise
  were avid skiers, and the yearly ski vacations and many other outdoor
  activities together with their two sons were important and cherished family
  traditions. After Louise’s untimely death in 1981, Peter married the renowned
  molecular biologist Patricia Spear in 1983. The following year, Peter and Pat
  moved into the city near the university. In their nineteen years together they
  actively pursued their common interests in music, theater and the outdoors.
  Together they traveled widely and often across the globe.</p>

  <p>Peter served unselfishly on numerous science policy committees. He is
  remembered for his fairness, open mind, and good advice. He received a number
  of honors, for example, the Quantrell teaching award at the University of
  Chicago, foreign membership in the Max-Planck-Institute for Extraterrestrial
  Physics in Garching, and the Alexander von Humboldt award for senior U.S.
  scientists. In 1989, Peter was elected to the National Academy of
  Sciences.</p>

  <p>Many people met Peter over his long and distinguished career: professional
  colleagues, managers at NASA and industry, engineers and technicians, numerous
  students, including seventeen who received their PhD’s under his advice. All
  of them will have fond and enduring memories of Peter as both a scientific
  leader and as a warm and caring human being.</p>

  <p>Peter Meyer is survived by his wife Patricia Spear, and his two sons
  Stephan and Andreas Meyer.</p>
