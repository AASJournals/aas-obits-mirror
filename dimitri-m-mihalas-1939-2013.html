  </p>

  <p>World-renowned astrophysicist Dimitri Mihalas passed away in his sleep at
  his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on November 21, 2013. Dr. Mihalas retired
  from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign in 1999 and from the Los
  Alamos National Laboratory in 2012. Dimitri, to his friends and family, has
  donated his body to the University of New Mexico Medical School and his
  library to New Mexico Tech.</p>

  <p>Dimitri was born on March 20, 1939 in Los Angeles, California where he grew
  up. He received his B.A., with Highest Honors, in three majors, Physics,
  Mathematics, and Astronomy, from the University of California at Los Angeles
  at age 20. Four years later he received his Ph.D. in Astronomy and Physics
  from the California Institute of Technology. He was a pioneer in computational
  astrophysics, and has remained a world leader in the fields of radiation
  transport, radiation hydrodynamics, and astrophysical quantitative
  spectroscopy for decades. His broad knowledge and immense contributions earned
  him election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1981 at age 42.</p>

  <p>Dimitri had an exceptional record of work. He published more than 150
  papers and technical reports, authored or co-authored eight books, and
  co-edited three others. Three of his books have been used as textbooks for
  both undergraduate and graduate students worldwide and have been translated
  into other languages, including Russian. His book <em>Foundations of Radiation
  Hydrodynamics</em> has become the “bible” of the radiation hydrodynamics
  community.</p>

  <p>Dimitri wrote his Ph.D. thesis on theoretical modelings for hydrogen and
  helium line strengths and profiles in O-stars. He interpreted the
  observational data with the best theoretical analysis possible at the time.
  The models were computed using the then prevailing simplifying approximation
  of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). As shown by its high number of
  citations, this work, primitive by today's standards, had a major impact on
  the field.</p>

  <p>After joining the faculty of the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at
  Princeton University, Dimitri undertook new analyses of stellar abundances,
  devised a method for constructing a constant-flux atmosphere with convection
  in the full transport (not diffusion) regime, computed the first
  line-blanketed spectrum of a hot B star which showed that continuum- only
  models overestimated the effective temperature by 10% (hence luminosity by
  40%), and computed a sample of H line-blanketed models accounting for the
  distortion of the continuum by the confluence of the hydrogen Balmer lines
  near 3650Å.</p>

  <p>Dimitri realized that the widely accepted approximation of LTE in stellar
  atmospheres is inadequate, so he undertook a major initiative to solve the
  analogous non-LTE problem. This is an exceptionally difficult problem owing to
  the need to solve self-consistently a set of coupled, highly nonlinear
  effects. Only the highly idealized case of a two-level atom with a single line
  and two continua had been solved previously.</p>

  <p>After several preliminary explorations of methodology with Auer, they
  reformulated the non-LTE stellar atmosphere problem in a completely original
  manner; applying the Newton- Raphson technique to the full nonlinear system,
  and iterating to convergence. This method was a breakthrough in the field – it
  revolutionized all further work on computing stellar atmospheres. Through his
  idea of “variable Eddington factors,” the method was made even more
  efficient.</p>

  <p>With this new methodology, Dimitri constructed an extensive, widely cited,
  sample of non-LTE models for hot stars, and used them to evaluate the effects
  of departures from LTE on observable stellar line and continuum indices. These
  results allowed Mihalas and Auer to perform several critical studies which
  were not previously possible, achieving for the first time good agreement
  between the computed and observed strengths of the hydrogen and helium lines,
  and surface gravities consistent with the stars' observed masses and element
  abundances obtained</p>

  <p>from nebular analyses. This work has been widely cited, both for the
  quality of fit to observations, as well as a “gold standard” for verification
  of present-day calculations using much faster iterative methods. Work with
  Hummer led to the discovery of the physical mechanism producing the emission
  the N III emission lines at wavelengths 4634 – 4650Å in O((f)) stars.</p>

  <p>In the 1970s, Dimitri devised the now standard method for solving the
  line-transfer problem in expanding spherical atmospheres in the comoving
  frame. This work was summarized in the heavily cited 2nd edition of his
  textbook <em>Stellar Atmospheres</em>, which remains the standard in the field
  even after 25 years. A third edition (with I. Hubeny) which describes modern
  fast, iterative methods to solve the transfer equation, including realistic
  line-blanketing, is in press.</p>

  <p>In the period 1981 – 1998, as a consultant to LANL, Dimitri gave lectures
  on radiation hydrodynamics, for which, he received a number of “Certificate of
  Appreciation” by X-Division for “Outstanding Service to the Applied
  Theoretical Division”. In 1984 Dimitri completed the above-mentioned
  <em>Foundations of Radiation Hydrodynamics</em>. In 1999 Dover Publications
  reprinted it in inexpensive paperbound form at the urging of many scientists
  from LANL, LLNL, NRL, and the academic community.</p>

  <p>In the period 1987 – 1994 Dimitri worked with Anderson, Hummer, and B.
  Mihalas on the development of a modern EOS code for stellar envelopes, in
  support of the large British – American Opacity Project (OP) led by Professor
  M. J. Seaton. It emerged that the OP results are in excellent agreement
  (better than 10%) with the independent LLNL OPAL computations. These new
  opacity data significantly impact stellar evolution calculations, and have
  helped resolve several previous discrepancies between calculation and
  observation, especially with the interpretation of Cepheid variable
  pulsations.</p>

  <p>Jointly with Stone, Dimitri showed that the computational oscillations or
  diffusion, typically found in numerical simulations of a propagating radiation
  front in vacuum, could be eliminated by using upwind monotonic interpolation
  methods. They (and M. Norman) also collaborated on incorporating 2-D radiative
  transfer in the radiation magnetohydrodynamics code ZEUS 2-D developed at the
  University of Illinois and extensively used by astrophysicists.</p>

  <p>In collaboration with K.-H. Winkler and M. Norman, Dimitri developed novel
  implicit adaptive grid methods to solve 1-D radiation hydrodynamics problems
  having multiple time and space scales ranging over many orders of magnitude.
  Dimitri derived the “adaptive-grid transport theorem” rigorously. In 1994 –
  1997, Dimitri developed TITAN, a 1-D implicit adaptive-grid code. In
  collaboration with Cheng at Los Alamos, Dimitri used TITAN to compute the
  best-ever numerical solution of the infamous Noh stagnating shock problem in
  planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometry. In 1999, in collaboration with
  Gehmeyr, and Sincell, Dimitri studied the famous Zel'dovich and
  Heaslet/Baldwin supercritical shock problem and was able to compute the first
  numerical solutions for this problem. Also in the same year, Dimitri and Auer
  wrote “An X-6 Radiation Hydrodynamics Primer” intended for LANL use, and in
  2001 they published an incisive discussion on exact relativistic
  laboratory-frame radiation hydrodynamics.</p>

  <p>Dimitri was honored for his many scientific contributions at the
  <em>International Conference in Honor of Dimitri Mihalas for his Lifetime
  Scientific Contributions on the Occasion of his 70th Birthday held in Boulder,
  CO in late March 2009.</em>
  </p>

  <p>In addition to his many scientific contributions, he also published several
  collections of his poetry and other writings. These other writings include "A
  Primer on Depression and Bipolar Disorder" and "Depression, Bipolar Disorder,
  and Spiritual Growth." These books have had as profound an impact as his
  professional textbooks and articles.</p>

  <p>Throughout his long career, Dimitri gave generously of himself to all with
  whom he interacted. As an advisor, role model, confidant, and friend, he saw
  each person as an individual, acknowledging strengths, helping overcome
  weaknesses, giving encouragement, and enthusiastically praising their success.
  He touched the lives and careers of many students and colleagues and has left
  a lasting legacy to be cherished by those who knew him.</p>
