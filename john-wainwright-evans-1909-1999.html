  <p>John Wainwright (Jack) Evans, a major figure in advancing the field of
  solar astronomy during his long and influential career, died at his home in
  Santa Fe, New Mexico, on October 31, 1999.</p>

  <p>Jack was born in New York City on May 14, 1909, where his father was a
  newspaper reporter. In 1928 he was awarded a scholarship to Swarthmore
  College, where there was a 24-inch telescope and a flourishing research
  program. When he graduated in 1932, it was at the height of the depression.
  Nevertheless, he received a fellowship for graduate work in the new but small
  astronomy department of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>In an interview in August 1999, Jack recalled that the departmental
  administrator had previously worked for Harlow Shapley at Harvard. She felt
  that he had more potential than could be fully exploited in the limited
  department at the University of Pennsylvania. After he had completed his
  second year, she contacted Harlow Shapley and Jack and his wife Betty
  transferred to Harvard College Observatory (HCO). There he came under the
  guidance and influence of Shapley. Jack remarked that "HCO was one big family
  thanks to Shapley's interest in everyone." Fellow graduate students included
  James Baker, famous for designing widefield aerial cameras; Leo Goldberg; and
  Jesse Greenstein. Jack graduated from Harvard with an MA and a PhD in
  astronomy in 1936 and 1938, respectively. His thesis supervisor was Bart
  Bok.</p>

  <p>Jack first spent a year as an instructor at the University of Minnesota.
  After that, Donald Menzel referred him to the position of instructor at Mills
  College in Oakland, CA. There, he worked at the Chabot Observatory and soon
  rose to the position of assistant professor. His time there turned out to be a
  "very enjoyable experience."</p>

  <p>With the outbreak of World War II, Jack contacted one of Menzel's friends
  at the University of Rochester about working in his optics laboratory. Dr.
  Brian O'Brien hired him to work there developing special optical systems for
  military use. Jack commented that O'Brien was "an optical engineer par
  excellence" and "the most knowledgeable person in optics" that he ever knew.
  Jack's experience in this group during the wartime years equipped him well in
  his subsequent career in solar physics where he devised many very innovative
  and valuable astronomical instruments.</p>

  <p>After the war the Fremont Pass Station of Harvard College Observatory
  became the High Altitude Observatory. Donald Menzel and Walter Roberts, the
  superintendent, offered Jack the position of assistant superintendent there.
  From 1946 to 1952, he worked in both Climax and Boulder, CO.</p>

  <p>Given such kinds of experiences and interactions during this era, it was
  not surprising that Jack was selected to head up the Air Force's new Upper Air
  Research Observatory located at Sacramento Peak in southern New Mexico. Here
  he enjoyed spending the rest of his career and raising his son and two
  daughters with his wife, Betty. In 1956 the name of the facility was changed
  to Sacramento Peak Observatory (Sac Peak). Later, in 1976, the National
  Science Foundation replaced the Air Force as manager and the name was again
  changed. It became the National Solar Observatory/Sacramento Peak. For the
  site name, Jack chose "Sunspot, " which became its postal address.</p>

  <p>Following his appointment to the facility at Sacramento Peak, Jack moved
  quickly to assemble a group of outstanding young scientists, many of whom
  subsequently made a major impact in solar physics. While carrying out his
  responsibilities as director in an exemplary manner for the next quarter
  century, Jack also made major contributions to the field in both
  instrumentation and solar research.</p>

  <p>He led two eclipse expeditions to observe the height-resolved chromospheric
  spectrum; the first was to Khartoum in 1952, and the second, to Puka Puka in
  the South Pacific, 1958. For these he designed two slitless spectrographs, and
  a jumping-film camera. The data from the Khartoum eclipse were critical in
  establishing the relative temperatures of the solar chromosphere and
  photosphere.</p>

  <p>In his 1999 interview, Jack remarked that he thought his work on the
  instruments and eclipse observations was probably "one of the best things"
  that he had ever done. Also of particular note were the detailed
  investigations of small-scale motions in the solar atmosphere that he started
  in 1960. He observed the nature of the five-minute oscillations and made the
  first quantitative measurements of the velocity amplitudes as a function of
  line strengths and heights in the solar atmosphere. He also took a special
  interest in flare mechanisms. For example, in 1958 he obtained data during the
  progress of a flare that showed, for the first time, associated changes in
  sunspot magnetic fields.</p>

  <p>Jack made extremely important contributions to the development of unique
  instrumentation. For example, his split-element form of the Lyot birefringent
  filter represented a major advance in the performance of these filters; and
  his polarizing two-beam interferometer analog form of this filter is today the
  basis of many helioseismic imaging instruments. He developed an
  externally-occulted form of the solar coronagraph that has been used
  extensively in satellite coronagraphs. The same principle is incorporated in
  the Evans sky photometer that is used at solar observatories around the world.
  He also designed a double-pass spectrograph for reduction of
  instrumentally-scattered light in solar absorption lines. This invention was
  spectacularly successful, reducing scattered light to an almost undetectable
  level, and thus solving a most troublesome problem of determining precise line
  profiles. He incorporated this concept into his design of the Sac Peak
  spectroheliograph which is still used in daily monitoring of solar activity.
  Such innovations serve to convey the caliber of his work in developing
  powerful instruments. Indeed, he made many more, too numerous to mention
  here.</p>

  <p>Jack received many honors and awards during his career, including the
  Newcomb Cleveland Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of
  Science (1957); Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1964); Honorary
  Doctor of Science, University of New Mexico (1967); Honorary Doctor of
  Science; Swarthmore College (1970); George Ellery Hale Prize of the Solar
  Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society (1982); and the
  Richardson Medal of the Optical Society of America (1987). He also received
  several prizes and awards from the Air Force: the Distinguished Civilian
  Service Award, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a civilian employee
  by the DoD (1965); the Guenter Loeser Memorial Award, AFCRL (1967); the
  Rockefeller Award for Distinguished Public Service (1969); and the Outstanding
  Achievement Award, AFOAR (1970).</p>

  <p>Despite all his outstanding professional accomplishments, Jack is
  remembered principally by colleagues for his personal qualities: a gracious
  person, a mentor, supporter, and genuine friend. His pursuit of excellence,
  combined with his scientific judgment and his talent for clever instrumental
  development, have had a major impact on solar astronomy. But his true legacy
  lies not in his own accomplishments, about which he was always modest, but in
  his inspiring leadership, which encouraged and motivated countless young solar
  astronomers to reach their own potentials as scientists of note.</p>
