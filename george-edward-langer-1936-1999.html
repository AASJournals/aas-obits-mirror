  <p>George Edward Langer, Professor of Physics at Colorado College, died of a
  pulmonary embolism February 16, 1999, in Colorado Springs. He had just begun
  treatment for lymphoma. He is survived by his sister Judy Corning, his wife,
  Jo, and his three children, Mary, Sarah and James.</p>

  <p>Ed was born July 17, 1936, in Madison, Wisconsin. He earned a BA and BS
  from Notre Dame University in 1959, and attended Cornell University as a
  Woodrow Wilson Fellow. After earning an MS in physics Ed taught for two years
  at Tuskegee Institute as a Woodrow Wilson Teaching Intern. In 1965 he returned
  to his graduate studies, earning his PhD in Astrophysics under the direction
  of J.P. Cox at the University of Colorado in 1969. In his thesis he explored
  the stellar structure of long-period variables and this topic provided a
  springboard for his later studies of the evolution of late-type stars in
  general. In particular, in a 1973 paper, he was the first to explain the
  chemical evolution of the strange variable star FG Sagittae, an object in
  which the enhancement of s-process species by a factor of 10-100 goes on
  before our very eyes.</p>

  <p>After Ed received his doctorate, he joined the Department of Physics at
  Colorado College (CC), where he taught undergraduate physics and astronomy.
  With disheveled hair, rumpled sweater and hiking boots, he was a familiar
  figure on the CC campus. However, the boots came off as soon as he got to his
  office, and he padded around in slippers or stocking feet for the rest of the
  day. He also had an aversion to ties, and there is an apocryphal story that he
  wore one only for his wedding, his children's weddings, and some of their
  graduations. Every school has a few outstanding teachers that students advise
  one another not to miss. Ed was one of those teachers at CC. His enthusiasm
  for physics and his obvious love of teaching drew students from all parts of
  the campus. He also loved to carry on research in astronomy. From 1971 to 1998
  he regularly visited the Lick Observatory, UC Santa Cruz, during the summer
  and during five sabbatical leaves. On visits to Lick and to Austin from 1980
  onwards, he was the real source of knowledge in the areas of stellar
  structure, stellar evolution and nuclear astrophysics for the "Lick-Texas"
  group. They were studying the chemical composition of metal-poor giants in the
  Galactic halo, based on high resolution spectra obtained at Lick, McDonald and
  Keck. Ed was especially interested in the problem of "deep mixing," in which
  the ashes of CNO cycle hydrogen burning are mixed into the atmospheres of such
  stars as they proceed from the main sequence up the giant branch into later
  evolutionary stages. He made seminal contributions to understanding the
  consequences of deep mixing, including not only the apparent depletion of C
  and O and corresponding enhancement of N, but also the production of Na and Al
  at the expense of Ne and Mg, respectively. With Rob Hoffman (UCSC) and Clyde
  Zaidins (CU Denver), he explored the possible production of<sup>27</sup> Al
  from<sup>24</sup> Mg, as well as the production of<sup>23</sup> Na
  from<sup>22</sup> Ne and<sup>20</sup> Ne, noting the conditions of shell
  temperature and pressure under which such transmutations would take place. He
  was the first to understand and describe at least two important consequences
  of deep mixing among globular cluster stars ascending the giant branch for the
  first time. First, he realized the atmospheric H/He ratio would change, with
  important ramifications for the color distribution of the horizontal branch.
  Secondly, that the introduction of fresh H from the envelope into the shell
  would slow the evolution and lead to an excess of bright giants above the
  predictions of standard evolutionary theory. Both of these predictions seem to
  have been borne out in recent investigations of HB morphology and globular
  cluster luminosity functions. Ed's colleagues will remember a salient feature
  of his outlook on science: think the problem through, make reasonable
  estimates, always look into the physics first. See what you can do before
  calling in the large computer programs. With Ed, there was always a sense of
  basic modesty and honesty, as he balanced his life between his teaching and
  mentoring of students and his lively interest in the mysteries of stellar
  evolution.</p>
