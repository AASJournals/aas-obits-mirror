  <p>On Monday, January 25, 1999, the world lost a pioneering astronomer, John
  H. (Jack) DeWitt, Jr. He died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age
  of 92. He was a Nashvillian from beginning to end, having been born there on
  February 20, 1906. Many have described Jack as a boy genius, a visionary, a
  pioneer, and a war hero. He was indeed many things during his lifetime, and a
  more detailed biography appeared in 1988, in issue No. 31 of the
  <em>I.A.P.P.P. Communications</em>.</p>

  <p>In 1922, at the age of 16, DeWitt built the first radio transmitting tower
  in Nashville and, later that same year, Nashville's first commercial
  broadcasting station. For more than two decades, 1947-1968, he was president
  of WSM-AM and -FM radio and -TV (home of the Grand Ole Opry). During that
  tenure he supervised installation of WSM's 878-foot-tall, 50,000 watt
  transmitting tower, for many years the tallest in North America; and he made
  WSM the first TV station in the country to broadcast near-real-time weather
  satellite photos.</p>

  <p>During World War II, Jack worked at Bell Laboratories and Evans Signal
  Laboratory, becoming director of Evans in 1943. He received the Legion of
  Merit for his contributions to the invention of the radar proximity fuse, the
  accomplishment of which he said he was proudest. Most astronomers, however,
  remember him best for Project Diana, bouncing a radar signal off the moon in
  1946. He thus became the "Father of Radar Astronomy," and was made a life
  fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers for this and
  other achievements in radio broadcasting.</p>

  <p>Jack the astronomer emerged in 1934, when he and his brother, Ward, built a
  12-inch Cassegrain telescope, complete with 12-foot dome, grinding the mirror
  themselves. Following completion of Project Diana, Jack returned to Nashville
  in 1947, arriving at almost the same time as Carl Keenan Seyfert (of Seyfert
  galaxies), the new professor of astronomy at Vanderbilt University. The two
  became fast friends. Almost immediately, Jack offered Carl the use of his
  12-inch (by then located under dark skies near the 878-foot radio tower) and
  constructed a dry-ice refrigerated photoelectric photometer and associated
  electronics for use on it. Several Vanderbilt graduate students earned Masters
  degrees for work with that photometer in the late 1940s and early 1950s,
  representing the first photoelectric photometry carried out in the South of
  the United States.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Jack was introducing Carl to influential people in Nashville,
  who soon became inspired by Carl's enthusiastic love of astronomy. It also
  helped that Jack made Carl the first TV weatherman in Nashville. The
  culmination was the Arthur J. Dyer Observatory, with its excellent and
  versatile 24-inch reflecting telescope and the beginnings of its splendid
  astronomy library, dedicated in 1983 to the 82 individuals and businesses from
  middle Tennessee who had made it possible.</p>

  <p>After Carl Seyfert's untimely death in an automobile accident in 1960, Jack
  continued his close involvement with Dyer Observatory, under its second
  director, Robert Howie Hardie. In 1970, Jack donated his 12-inch telescope to
  Vanderbilt and oversaw its installation at Dyer, where it was formally
  dedicated in 1983, on the occasion of the Observatory's 30th anniversary.
  Later Jack himself, by then in his 80s, motorized the dome slit. The telescope
  and its dome have since been completely refurbished and are still enjoyed by
  Nashvillians of all ages during Dyer's open house viewing nights.</p>

  <p>Jack's love of and commitment to astronomy were evident in his hometown
  newspaper obituary, which closed with the request that "memorials be made to
  the Arthur J. Dyer Observatory. " In return, Dyer has established a fund to
  support the DeWitt Public Lecture in Astronomy, in Jack's memory.</p>
