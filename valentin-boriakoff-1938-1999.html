  <p>Valentin Boriakoff died of kidney failure on 6 August 1999. Val was a radio
  astronomer with an extensive background in microelectronics and astrophysics.
  He conducted very high-resolution radio observations of pulsars to explore the
  microstructure of their pulse profiles, a research area of special importance
  for understanding the still-mysterious mechanism of pulsar radio emission. In
  1983, a year after the discovery of the first (solitary) millisecond pulsar,
  Val and his Italian colleagues found PSR 1953+29, the first binary millisecond
  pulsar, which had a substantial impact on the theory of evolution of neutron
  stars in binary systems.</p>

  <p>More recently, Boriakoff had continued the study of this system to identify
  the very dim optical companion of the pulsar. He also contributed to the study
  of interstellar electron-density fluctuations and to the determination of the
  interstellar magnetic field strength in the directions of galactic pulsars. In
  addition to the AAS, he was a long-term member of the International
  Astronomical Union and its Commission on radio astronomy.</p>

  <p>Val was born on 8 October 1938 in Argentina and graduated from the
  University of Buenos Aires in 1963 as an Ingeniero Electromecanico de
  orientacio Electronica (approximately equivalent to a Master of Science in
  Electrical Engineering). He served as an electronics engineer at the Argentine
  Radio Astronomy Institute before immigrating to the United States, where he
  first worked at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West
  Virginia. In 1967, he entered the graduate program in astronomy at Cornell
  University, receiving his PhD in 1973 for work with Frank Drake on "Pulsar
  Radio Frequency Observations with a Digital Pulsar Processor." He became a
  research associate at the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center, rising to
  senior research associate and eventually associate professor in the Department
  of Electrical Engineering at Cornell.</p>

  <p>From 1985 to 1993, Boriakoff also served as an adjunct professor in the
  Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma, and he was
  an associate professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Worcester
  Polytechnic Institute (WPI) from 1988 to 1994. Since 1995 he had been a senior
  research associate of the National Research Council in the Geophysics
  Directorate (now Directorate of Space Vehicles) at the Phillips Laboratory of
  the Air Force Research Laboratory, and at the time of his death he was also
  adjunct professor of Mechanical Engineering at WPI.</p>

  <p>Val retained a life-long interest in astronomy, especially pulsar
  observations. One of his early papers described an unexpected
  quasi-periodicity at about a millisecond in PSR 2016+28, and he speculated
  that this might be due to oscillations of the neutron star, reawakening
  interest in neutron star oscillation on the part of other astronomers. Val
  devoted much of his career to further observational studies of pulsar
  microstructure, quasi-periodicity, mode-switching, emission mechanisms, and
  effects of the interstellar medium. His broader research interests included
  planetary science, galactic astronomy, and, more recently, solar physics,
  geomagnetic activity, and climate change. He brought to all of these sound
  scientific skepticism and innovative approaches. He was a fount of new ideas
  and scientific projects that extended far beyond his main scientific
  interests.</p>

  <p>Val Boriakoff was also a man of broad culture and personal charm. His
  excitement for his science was unmistakable. Those who worked with him came to
  know the signs of yet another of his creative ideas—the breaking of an
  engaging smile, the brightening of the twinkle in his eye, the lightning pace
  of the "if/then/else" thought process that followed, and then his all-engaging
  question, "Now how can we make this work?"</p>

  <p>Val will remain in the hearts of his friends and colleagues as a warm human
  being with merrily twinkling eyes and a welcoming smile. He is survived by his
  wife Tamara of Northborough, Massachusetts and two sons, Alexander and
  Andrei.</p>
