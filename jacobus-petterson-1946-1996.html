      <h1>Jacobus A. Petterson (1946-1996)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Jacobus ("Koos") Petterson, best known in the astronomical community for
  his analysis of X-ray binary systems, died at his home in Carrollton, Georgia
  on 30 May 1996. Petterson was born in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, on 16 August
  1946 and received an MS in Engineering Mathematics in 1970 from the Technical
  University in Delft for work with A. J. Hermans on "a quantum mechanical
  treatment of the mirror electron microscope." He went on to graduate work in
  mathematics and physics, initially at Case Western Reserve University, and
  then at Yale, where he earned a PhD in physics in 1976, having investigated
  both general relativistic and classical effects in the vicinity of black holes
  and neutron stars in binary systems.</p>

  <p>Petterson's subsequent career was tragically brief. He moved sequentially
  from a research associateship at Princeton (1976-77), to a visiting assistant
  professorship at University of Illinois (1978-80), where the students ranked
  him as an excellent teacher, an assistant professorship of physics at New
  Mexico Tech (1980-84), and the chairmanship of the physics department of West
  Georgia College in Carrollton (1984-88). A visiting position in astrophysics
  at University of California, San Diego, where he had started working on
  processes in elliptical galaxies like the ones he had previously studied in
  binary stars, was cut short by the development of the brain tumor that
  eventually killed him. He was a member of AAS for a relatively short period
  around 1980.</p>

  <p>Koos's most-cited papers date from 1975-80 and concern streams and disks in
  X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables. He was also involved in the
  development of half a dozen computer-graphics films illustrating Hercules X-l,
  SS 433, and other systems. His last paper, a collaboration with J.P. Greenberg
  and R. Iping on instabilities in X-ray binary disks, appeared in 1992.
  Petterson is survived by his wife, Rosina Iping, whom he married in 1980, and
  their children Ingeborg and Maximilian.</p>
