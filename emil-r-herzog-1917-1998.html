      <h1>Emil R. Herzog (1917-1998)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Emil Rudolf Herzog, astronomer, and, since 1987, retired professor of
  mathematics at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, California,
  died peacefully of heart failure on April 23, 1998.</p>

  <p>Emil came from Riehen, Switzerland, attended the
  Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliches Gymnasium in Basel, was graduated
  <em>summa cum laude</em> in mathematics from the University of Basel, and
  earned his PhD there in 1946 with a thesis titled "Die Methoden der
  Astronomisch-Geographischen Ortsbestimmung in systematischer Behandlung." One
  of his earlier papers, "Die Anwendung der Riemannschen Zahlenkugel zur
  Herleitung der spherischtrigonometrischen Hauptsetze" (1953), was an elegant
  and original generalized derivation of the three fundamental formulas of
  spherical trigonometry, using a projection on the Riemannian sphere.</p>

  <p>Because Emil published rather little, his brilliance in mathematics was
  known mainly to his friends and students. He had read, understood in depth,
  and had at hand, all of the classics of anlysis by Euler, Gauss, and others.
  As he would solve some problem new to him, he would usually voice his
  thoughts. These thoughts were, in fact, delightfully lucid lectures on his
  methods of reasoning for those of us honored to have heard them.</p>

  <p>In astronomy, Emil worked at Caltech and Palomar Observatory with Fritz
  Zwicky (1949-1951 and 1956-1968) on the pioneering six-volume <em>Catalogue of
  Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies</em>, published between 1951 and 1968. While
  the delineation of the clusters on the 48-inch Palomar Schmidt plates was
  Zwicky's work, all of the measurementts of the tens of thousands of individual
  galaxies were Emil's: photographing each field with the 18-inch Palomar
  Schmidt, measuring coordinates, and preparing finding charts. In addition, he
  determined the apparent magnitudes of the brighter galaxies by schraffier
  guided plates and a flyspanker. For the fainter objects, where the schraffier
  images were too washed out to be measurable, Emil found that his
  nearsightedness made schraffier images unnecessary. His familiarity with the
  48-inch Schmidt plates led him to be one of the first to be aware of the
  character of the large-scale distribution of galaxies.</p>

  <p>Teaching was a significant part of Emil's career: in mathematics at the
  Institut Athenaeum, Basel 1946-1948 and 1951-1956, in astronomy at the
  University of Southern California 1965-1968, and again in mathematics at Cal
  Poly Pomona 1968-1987, where, from 1974-1980, he was chair of the Department
  of Mathematics.</p>

  <p>Emil was a quiet gentleman, by no means shy, and an unmerciful master chess
  player. His deep understanding of human nature, including his own, gave him
  the ability to get along well with many of the notorious "prima donnas" of
  astronomy. He had a strong sense of humor, which he needed. A favorite
  admonition was, "Some people get into trouble because they don't tell the
  truth, and other people get into trouble because they do." Emil always told
  the truth, but very gently.</p>

  <p>Emil Herzog leaves Gertrud, his wife of 51 years, his astronomer son, Dr.
  Adrian Herzog, and a daughter-in-law Tiambun Napitupulu, as well as many
  friends and admirers.</p>

  <p><em>Note from the Editor [Virginia Trimble]:</em> Herzog's understanding of
  the large-scale distribution of galaxies did not entirely agree with Zwicky's.
  At a colloquium at Caltech in the mid 1960s I heard him say that he saw
  evidence of superclustering (which Zwicky absolutely denied), immediately
  followed by George Abell (one of the discoverers of superclustering) standing
  up and offering Emil "political asylum" at UCLA.</p>
