  <p>Alex Dalgarno’s major contributions to the understanding of fundamental
  atomic and molecular processes enabled him to develop diagnostics of the
  physical conditions of atmospheres and astrophysical sources and to elucidate
  the roles of such processes in controlling those environments. He greatly
  influenced the research of physicists, chemists, atmospheric scientists, and
  astronomers, leading Sir David Bates to write, “There is no greater figure
  than Alex in the history of atomic physics and its applications.”</p>

  <p>Alex was born and grew up in London. As a child, he enjoyed mathematical
  puzzles and did well at sports. He was invited to try out for the Tottenham
  Hotspur soccer team, but his professional sporting career ended due to an
  injury, which did not prevent Alex playing tennis and squash into his ninth
  decade.</p>

  <p>In 1945 Alex began to study Mathematics at University College London (UCL).
  In 1947 Sir Harrie Massey invited him to work for a PhD in Physics and
  suggested that Alex investigate collisions of metastable helium atoms in
  helium gas to determine the cross sections for excitation transfer. Richard
  Buckingham was Alex’s immediate supervisor.</p>

  <p>After completing his graduate study in 1951, Alex became a member of staff
  in Applied Mathematics at the Queen’s University of Belfast (QUB). He served
  as the Director of the Computational Laboratory after a 1954 visit to MIT,
  which had an electronic computer, led Alex to persuade colleagues that QUB
  needed one.</p>

  <p>In 1957, the poet Philip Larkin was the best man at the marriage of Alex to
  Barbara Kane. They had four children, Fergus, Penelope, Piers, and Rebecca,
  but the marriage dissolved after ten years.</p>

  <p>Alex’s important work during the 1950s on the quantitative evaluation of
  long-range interactions underpinned his collaborations on precise scattering
  calculations relevant to ultra-cold collisions and the formation of atomic
  Bose-Einstein condensates over four decades later. He investigated the theory
  of atomic and molecular collisions and calculated charge transfer cross
  sections. Some of these proved later to be important for forming the spectra
  of diffuse astronomical matter surrounding high mass stars and 100 million
  solar mass black holes at the centers of active galaxies. In the early 1950s
  David Bates stimulated Alex’s interest in the study of quantum processes
  occurring in the upper terrestrial atmosphere. Together they considered the
  sources of the nightglow and dayglow features and concluded that the altitudes
  previously inferred for them from observations were up to several hundred
  kilometers too large. Experiments carried on V2 rockets, like those seen by
  Alex in wartime London, proved him and David to be right.</p>

  <p>Alex felt that though many theorists believe that “physics is embodied in
  its equations,” it is instead “to be found in the solutions to the equations.”
  He was a master at developing and applying methods that simplified
  calculations leading to reliable solutions. Exploiting the contemporary
  advances in electronic computation, by the 1960s Alex and his colleagues were
  able to address atomic and molecular processes of increasing complexity. Their
  development and early applications of the S-matrix theory of molecular
  rotational excitation by particle impact triggered major advances in molecular
  physics and theoretical chemistry and in the understanding of processes
  important in many environments, including a wide variety of astrophysical
  sources.</p>

  <p>In 1967 Alex became a professor in the Harvard Department of Astronomy and
  a member of the staff of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. He was a
  team member for several Atmosphere Explorer satellite missions, which
  elucidated the roles of atoms and ions in the upper atmosphere and paved the
  way for further applications to the other planets. By 1969 Alex was publishing
  papers on molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) radiative processes, including
  photodissociation, in which the foundations of molecular astrophysics began to
  emerge. H<sub>2</sub> is the most abundant astrophysical molecule and the main
  constituent of the regions where stars form. Interstellar H<sub>2</sub> was
  first detected directly in the following year, and data for interstellar
  H<sub>2</sub> began to become abundant in 1973. Alex was well prepared and led
  efforts to interpret these data, from which he was able to infer the physical
  properties of diffuse interstellar molecular clouds. At nearly the same time
  he was involved in work on the ionization and energy deposition in
  H<sub>2</sub> by nearly relativistic and relativistic particles called cosmic
  rays. The work has relevance to emission in the atmospheres of the giant
  planets, as well as for conditions in interstellar molecular clouds. Cosmic
  ray induced ionization initiates much of the basic chemistry in star forming
  regions, and the emissions of the product molecules control the temperatures
  and allow the diagnosis of the physical conditions and dynamics of the stellar
  nurseries. For more than four decades Alex elucidated the chemical networks
  governing the molecular abundances in a wide variety of astrophysical sources
  including star forming regions, supernova ejecta, the pregalactic universe,
  and extreme environments like those in the vicinities of X-ray sources powered
  by accretion onto black holes. The refinement of the models led to
  calculations predicting the existence of subsequently discovered negative ions
  in giant molecular clouds. One of his astrophysical interests that intrigued
  him late in his career was the emission of soft X-rays by comets and in the
  heliosphere due to charge transfer with solar wind particles, and he also
  worked on related processes occurring in the atmospheres of the giant
  planets.</p>

  <p>Alex remained very active in fundamental atomic and molecular physics, as
  well as for its applications to astrophysics and to terrestrial and
  extraterrestrial planetary atmospheres. Ultra-cold collisions and ultra-cold
  chemistry were major interests for Alex for much of the latest phase of his
  career, most recently with pioneering work on atom-molecule collisions.</p>

  <p>In the early 1980s Alex had concerns about the future of atomic, molecular,
  and optical (AMO) physics in the United States, where it was inadequately
  funded and somewhat out of fashion in many of the physics departments
  providing most of the physicists who became university faculty. Alex played a
  key role in efforts to address this issue and led a proposal to the National
  Science Foundation that resulted in the founding on 1 November 1988 of the
  Institute of Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at the
  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Alex served for five years as the
  first ITAMP director. A number of the former ITAMP students and postdoctoral
  researchers have become leading AMO physicists, and its visitor program and
  workshops have led to the identification and stimulation of the leading areas
  of AMO physics.</p>

  <p>Alex was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a member of the National Academy of
  Sciences, and a member (Honorary) of the Royal Irish Academy. He received many
  medals, including the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics, the Royal Society’s
  Hughes Medal, the Royal Astronomical Society’s Gold Medal, the American
  Geophysical Society’s Fleming Medal, and the Royal Society of Chemistry’s
  Spiers Medal. He served as the editor of the <em>Astrophysical Journal
  Letters</em> for nearly thirty years starting in 1973, as the Chair of the
  Harvard Department of Astronomy from 1971 to 1976, and as the Acting Director
  of Harvard College Observatory and then the Acting Director of the
  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 1971 to 1973 during a
  critical period of its existence.</p>

  <p>Alex was a gifted mentor who spoke and wrote with pride of his former
  students and postdoctoral researchers. He was able to match projects very well
  with the abilities of the students. He made availability to students a special
  priority, and despite his supply of problems would encourage students as they
  developed their own. Alex was very supportive of junior scientists as they
  developed their careers, and in addition to writing many letters of
  recommendation he made many visits to colleagues as they were establishing
  themselves elsewhere. Furthermore, Alex very graciously hosted a number of his
  former students when they visited. He combined quiet modesty with a confidence
  that reassured others, and his humor was dry, interactive, and friendly.</p>

  <p>Alex passed away peacefully on 9 April 2015 in Cambridge, Massachusetts in
  the company of Fern Creelan, who was his partner for 30 years.</p>
