      <h1>Robert Leroy Wildey (1934-1998)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>On January 4, 1998, Dr. Robert L. Wildey, Professor of Mathematical Physics
  at Northern Arizona University (NAU) passed away unexpectedly in Flagstaff,
  Arizona. He had been a member of the Physics and Astronomy faculty since
  1981.</p>

  <p>Bob was born August 22, 1934, in Los Angeles, California and began his
  career in 1959 as a Research Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while
  pursuing his PhD at the California Institute of Technology (BS 1957, MS 1958,
  PhD 1962, all in astronomy and astrophysics). In 1961, he was appointed first
  a Research Fellow at Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories, and then a
  Lecturer in Astronomy and Geology in the Division of Geological Sciences at
  CIT, after completing his degree in 1962 with a thesis on the stellar content
  of the Perseus spiral arm (with advice from H.C. Arp and A.R. Sandage). During
  this period, his pioneering work contributed significantly to the field of
  infrared astronomy, with particular emphasis on the l0-micron window, in
  collaboration with Bruce Murray and James Westphal.</p>

  <p>In 1965, Bob joined Flagstaff's Astrogeology branch of the US Geological
  Survey (USGS) as an astrophysicist, where his research interests began to
  migrate toward the Moon and other solar system objects. In spite of this
  shift, his interests beyond the solar system remained strong, reaching as far
  as the topic of his 1965 paper in
    <cite>
      Probe</cite>, entitled "Science, Philosophy, and Zen Buddhism," as well as
      the more conventional areas of variable stars and globular clusters. He
      received a NASA Certificate of Appreciation for his contributions to the
      Apollo Program.</p>
  <p>NAU became Bob's home in 1971, when he was appointed to its faculty as an
  Associate Professor of Astrophysics and Astronomy. In 1981, he was promoted to
  Professor of Mathematical Physics and Astronomy, a position he held until his
  untimely death. During his tenure at NAU. Wildey continued his collaborations
  with colleagues at the Flagstaff Branch of the USGS, where he aggressively
  pursued his studies of Moon. This interest blossomed into the most ambitious
  research project of his life. He built the NAU/USGS Robot Lunar Observatory,
  to measure the Moon's albedo in the visible and near infrared spectral
  regions, at an accuracy sufficient for use as a photometric standard by the
  Earth Orbiting Satellite. Bob's own words describe his planned, final phase
  for this project as "a comprehensive program of radiometric observation of the
  Moon and standard stars into the period beyond emeritus professorship." Much
  had already been accomplished and published, in collaboration with Hugh
  Kieffer of USGS.</p>

  <p>Bob's research was only part of his contribution to his profession. His
  teaching at Caltech included all lower division standard courses in physics
  and astronomy and the development of graduate courses in observational
  techniques for planetary astronomy. At NAU, he not only lectured in all the
  upper division theoretical undergraduate courses, but he also developed an
  undergraduate course in general relativity and taught an honors colloquium in
  natural philosophy. He was a member of the International Astronomical Union
  (Commissions 16 and 17), the American Geophysical Union, the Astronomical
  Society of the Pacific, the Geological Society of America, and the Royal
  Astronomical Society, as well as of AAS.</p>

  <p>Fellow faculty remember Bob for his biting wit, his high standards, and his
  true concern for his students. Students were more often in awe of him than
  not, and frequently saw the value of his rigor and style only well after their
  experience in his classes. Gary Bowman, a student from the late 1980's, who
  has since joined the NAU faculty, remarked, "Over the year, I had many long
  talks with him on diverse subjects ranging from steam locomotives to physics
  to religion. While Bob may not have always suffered fools gladly, he exhibited
  a benevolent tolerance of those with whom he disagreed." As a scientist,
  Bowman adds, "Bob was not a technician ... He was a man of deep insight ...
  Here was someone who saw in physics a deep and personal quest, a supremely
  worthwhile way to spend one's life."</p>

  <p>Wildey is survived by his wife, Diane, sons Herbert and Robert, daughter
  Wendy Carol, and a number of other family members and friends, and was
  predeceased by an infant son. His career was punctuated with too many firsts
  and honors to list here. But for NAU, the biggest honor was having him on our
  faculty. We all miss him.</p>
