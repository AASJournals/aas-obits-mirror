      <h1>Harry W. Fulbright (1918-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Harry W. Fulbright, Emeritus Professor in Physics at the University of
  Rochester, died May 16, 2009 at the age of 90. His distinguished career
  spanned many disciplines. During WWII, he worked on the Manhattan Project at
  Washington University and at Los Alamos for two years, and spent 4 years on
  the Princeton University faculty before joining the faculty at Rochester in
  1950. Fulbright retired July 1, 1989, having spent years at Rochester as an
  experimental physicist who among other things renovated a 26-inch cyclotron,
  turning it into the first variable energy cyclotron used. It became the center
  of the department's low energy nuclear experimentation until another faculty
  member installed a Van de Graaf which replaced it. That cyclotron was later
  shipped to India where Fulbright helped install it for its second career.</p>

  <p>Although Fulbright concentrated on nuclear physics for most of his career,
  his interests turned to Astronomy in his later years. Fulbright spent the
  summer of 1986 helping to design and build equipment for a holographic
  determination of and improvement of the shape of the 140 ft. diameter Green
  Bank radio dish. He spent several weeks the next year at Green Bank,
  continuing the collaboration with Ron Maddalena and other staff members on the
  project, alternately making measurements and then panel adjustments. The
  result, according to observations made on standard sources, was a substantial
  improvement in antenna efficiency. The time required for an observation at 24
  GHz was reduced by a factor of two or three. He participated in observations
  with that dish involving 12 GHz signals from geostationary communication
  satellites. Fulbright joined Bill Forrest and John Bally in VLA (B array) HI
  observations of regions near high velocity outflow star forming and evolved
  objects. Little, if any, HI emission was evident in these data.</p>

  <p>As the director of the Advanced Undergraduate Lab in Physics and Astronomy,
  Fulbright included astronomical experiments in the complement he developed
  over the 11 year period before he retired. Among other experiments, he
  retrofitted an existing spectrograph with a thermoelectrically cooled 2048
  element linear CCD to use at the University's C.E.K. Mees Observatory. A
  simple sliding shutter built into the slit structure of the spectrograph
  allowed automatic computer-controlled cyclic background subtraction. In
  addition, the students did all computer programming required for device
  control, for monitoring and recording of data, and for wavelength calibration.
  Preliminary tests were made with the collaboration of Dave Meisel, SUNY
  Geneseo, then Associate Director of Mees. Several student senior theses
  utilized this instrument. With other students, Fulbright built a sensitive
  low-noise 21-cm receiver and Dicke Switch for a computer controlled 8-foot
  dish antenna (used originally for satellite work), which he mounted on the
  roof of the Rochester Physics building. Undergraduate students over a several
  year period joined him in designing, constructing and improving the
  electronics for 21-cm observations. They were able to map the Milky Way until
  a new radar at the airport put them out of the faint object business. After
  that they followed the radio emission of the Sun during almost a full solar
  cycle. In 1988 he helped two other students built a small, two-dimensional CCD
  camera intended for use at Mees, incorporating a small TI 211, 192x 165 pixels
  element, a thermoelectric cooler, and a mechanical shutter, with operation and
  data acquisition under computer control. Following his retirement in 1989 he
  continued to work with the Advanced Lab students for several years.</p>

  <p>Harry Fulbright was a brilliant and versatile experimentalist, and passed
  on these skills to the present generation. He is sorely missed by all in the
  Rochester Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
