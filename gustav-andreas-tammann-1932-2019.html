  <p><strong>Gustav Tammann died on Sunday the 6<sup>th</sup> of January
  2019.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Gustav Andreas Tammann, a pillar of 20<sup>th</sup> century astrophysics,
  has passed away at the age of 86. During his long and successful astronomical
  career, he made seminal contributions to extragalactic astrophysics and
  cosmology. He is best known for his work towards the determination of the
  Hubble constant and the use of supernovae as cosmic distance indicators. For
  many years Tammann was the leading extragalactic astronomer in Europe. After
  receiving his degree from the University of Basel, Switzerland, Tammann moved
  to the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories in Pasadena, California, as a
  Research Associate. On his return to Europe he first held a professorship in
  Hamburg and from 1977 until his retirement in 2002 was Director of the
  Astronomical Institute in Basel.</p>

  <p>While in Pasadena, Tammann and Allan Sandage initiated a research program
  resulting in a collaboration lasting over four decades to establish the cosmic
  distance ladder and ultimately measure the value of the Hubble constant. After
  preliminary work on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation (now called the
  Leavitt relation), they set out in 1974 to define the sequence of
  measurements, a series of stellar and galaxy calibrations at larger and larger
  distances resting on the previous step, until they would reach the smooth
  expansion field. They outlined a program, which they completed with only minor
  modifications after about 20 years. Every rung of the distance ladder was
  carefully investigated until they reached distances in the smooth Hubble flow
  to establish the current cosmic expansion rate. This required detailed
  analyses of many different astronomical objects and the corresponding
  understanding of the relevant astrophysics. They also realized that the local
  non-uniform matter distribution influences the value of the expansion rate and
  determined the distribution of galaxies and nearby galaxy clusters.</p>

  <p>Tammann and Sandage published the Revised Shapley-Ames Catalogue in 1981
  (with a further revision/expansion in 1987) and provided a first cut at the
  bright galaxy distribution. The original list of galaxies brighter than
  magnitude 13.2 (a total of 1246 galaxies) was updated with an additional 896
  missing from the original Shapley-Ames Catalogue. The Virgo Cluster of
  galaxies is the closest overdensity and was extensively investigated through a
  dedicated large-scale imaging project. This observing program produced the
  first complete set of luminosity functions for different morphological galaxy
  types extending to dwarf galaxies. New dwarf galaxy types were described, e.g.
  nucleated dwarf galaxies and ultra-diffuse galaxies, now subjects of intense
  studies. The local velocity field – most notably the infall of the Local Group
  towards the Virgo Cluster – and the motion of the Milky Way relative to the
  microwave background were determined by Tammann and several of his
  students.</p>

  <p>Beginning in the early 1970s Tammann studied supernovae, their rates and
  dependencies on host galaxies. In visionary publications he charted the use of
  supernovae for cosmology. He strongly advocated supernovae, in particular Type
  Ia supernovae, as cosmic distance indicators and for other cosmological
  applications, e.g. time dilation to test general relativity. He foresaw the
  importance of upcoming new facilities, in particular the Hubble Space
  Telescope and the new generation of ground-based 8m to 10m telescopes, for
  cosmology. Tammann, together with Sandage and Abhijit Saha, recognized the
  opportunity offered by HST to calibrate Type Ia supernovae through Cepheid
  stars. Over two decades they established Cepheid distances to nearby galaxies
  with observed Type Ia Supernovae and derived the Hubble constant. The
  competing HST Key Program adopted Type Ia Supernovae as their distance
  indicators in the Hubble flow following the precepts of Tammann and Sandage.
  HST calibrations of Type Ia supernovae through Cepheid distances continue in
  several major observing projects. The local expansion rate is now almost
  exclusively measured through Type Ia supernovae. The exact value of the Hubble
  constant remains a matter of vigorous research, although at a considerably
  higher accuracy and precision than the acrimonious debates of 50 to 20 years
  ago which formed an important part of Tammann’s scientific career. Tammann was
  further vindicated by the success of Type Ia supernovae providing evidence for
  an accelerated cosmic expansion.</p>

  <p>Gustav Andreas Tammann received many distinctions including the
  Karl-Schwarzschild Medaille of the Astronomische Gesellschaft, the
  Albert-Einstein-Medaille of the Einstein Gesellschaft Bern and the
  Tomalla-Preis by the Tomalla Foundation. Tammann was a Fellow of the American
  Association for the Advancement of Science. He was a Visiting Associate at the
  Hale Observatories from 1976 until 1985. From 1981 to 1984 Tammann served as
  president of the Astronomische Gesellschaft. He held important functions for
  ESO (Research Associate 1975-1993 and Swiss Council member 1992-2002), ESA
  (Space Telescope Advisory Team 1982-1992) and was instrumental in the
  establishment of the International Space Science Institute in Berne,
  Switzerland. He was also an elected member of several European academies.</p>

  <p>Tammann had a charming personality and exhibited an extraordinary
  friendliness. He was the proverbial gentleman astronomer in behaviour and
  attire. Tammann was involved in some of the most intense scientific
  discussions in cosmology and strongly advocated his view of the results. He
  could on occasion be an intense collaborator with clear opinions and strong
  ideas.</p>

  <p>Tammann’s interest is history is documented by his book on Comet Halley
  (with Philippe Véron), in which they collected the historical records on the
  sightings of this iconic comet. Tammann was known to a wider public through
  his appearances on radio and television. His enthusiasm for astronomy easily
  transferred to his audience. He engaged his listeners and would often show his
  wit and broad knowledge in illuminating exchanges.</p>
