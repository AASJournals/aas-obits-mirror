      <h1>Von Russel Eshleman (1924-2017)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Von Russel Eshleman died peacefully on September 22, 2017, five days after
  his 93rd birthday. Although he began his career in radar astronomy, he is best
  known as a pioneer in the use of spacecraft radio signals for precise
  measurements in planetary exploration — specifically, the radio occultation
  method for profiling planetary atmospheres and ionospheres, which has now been
  "brought home" for monitoring Earth's atmosphere using GPS satellites.</p>
  
  <p>Von was the youngest of four boys born in Covington, Ohio, a farming
  community with a large population of Old German Baptist Brethren, from which
  his grandfather had broken away in the late 1800s. He progressed rapidly
  through his early school years, then served as an electronics technician in
  the U.S. Navy during World War II (1943-46). While stationed in Italy at the
  end of the war, he became intrigued by the possibility of bouncing radio
  signals from the lunar surface. Although his own ship-based experiments were
  unsuccessful, this curiosity guided his professional life for the next 60
  years.</p>

  <p>He attended the General Motors Institute of Technology and
  Ohio State University before graduating with a bachelor's degree in electrical
  engineering from George Washington University in 1949. While at GWU, he met
  and married Patricia Middleton and they had the first of four children.
  Recruited to graduate school at Stanford University by Fred Terman, he
  obtained an MS in 1950 and a Ph.D. in 1952. His doctoral research, supervised
  by Mike Villard and Larry Manning, was on radio reflections from ionized
  meteor trails in the upper Earth's atmosphere.</p>

  <p>After serving five
  years as a member of Stanford's Electrical Engineering research staff, Von was
  promoted to Assistant Professor in 1957, then Associate Professor, and finally
  full Professor in 1962. With colleagues Allen Peterson and Ray Leadabrand, he
  founded the Stanford Center for Radar Astronomy in 1962, which oversaw two-way
  dual-frequency radio propagation experiments between Stanford's 150-foot
  antenna ('The Dish') and Pioneers 6-9 in orbit around the Sun, measuring the
  density, velocity, and structure of the solar wind.</p>

  <p>By the
  mid-1960s Eshleman's team had refocused on planets and on the
  telecommunications signals normally used to transmit spacecraft images and
  other remotely acquired data. The radio signals themselves are perturbed when
  a spacecraft flies behind a planet; by measuring the small changes in
  frequency, it is possible to determine the temperature and pressure profile of
  an occulting atmosphere (very similar to the results returned by a weather
  balloon) and the electron density of an ionosphere. The experiments were
  originally proposed for an 'uplink' geometry (transmission from Earth to the
  spacecraft), but only 'downlink' implementations were approved. Nonetheless,
  graduate students Gunnar Fjeldbo and Len Tyler (among others) perfected the
  technique and were rewarded with the first profiles from Mars (cold and thin)
  and Venus (hot and dense) in 1965 and 1967, respectively. Eshleman and his
  associates also demonstrated that properties of planetary surfaces could be
  derived from radio echoes reflected from the Moon and Mars.</p>

  <p>Eshleman was not involved in Pioneer 10 and 11 radio occultation
  experiments at Jupiter until it became apparent that the radio results
  differed radically from results obtained by other instruments. Over several
  years, Von and others worked out the corrections needed for analysis when
  planets are oblate (as the gas giants are because of their rapid rotation).
  The effects of turbulence and magnetic fields were incorporated by Bjarne
  Haugstad and Dave Hinson. Von led the Radio Science Team through the very
  successful Voyager 1 and 2 planning, implementation, and Jupiter encounters,
  then handed off day-to-day operations to Tyler.</p>

  <p>After Voyager,
  Eshleman focused on topics such as evolute flashes during deep radio
  occultations, stellar gravitational lenses and their effects on propagating
  radio waves, ring particle dynamics, absorption in planetary atmospheres (with
  students Paul Steffes and Tom Spilker), and retro-reflection from icy
  planetary surfaces. Although not a member of the science team, he got to see
  the ultimate radio occultation experiment (an uplink implementation) when New
  Horizons passed Pluto and signals transmitted from Earth were perturbed by its
  barely detectable atmosphere.</p>

  <p>Dozens of graduate students benefited
  from Von's direct mentoring; but he was also an innovative classroom teacher.
  He converted a mezzanine-level class on electromagnetics to a generalized
  "waves" class for a broader audience of Stanford graduate students — such as
  those interested in acoustics, seismology, and oceanography. For advanced
  undergraduates, he developed a new class called "Planetary Exploration", which
  was attractive to students with science, engineering, and mathematics skills
  but who were not majoring in astronomy.</p>

  <p>Von maintained contacts
  with industry, serving as a consultant for North American Rockwell and
  Watkins-Johnson. He advised the McGraw-Hill Book Company, the National Bureau
  of Standards, and (of course) the National Aeronautics and Space
  Administration. He also served briefly as Deputy Director of the Office of
  Technology Policy and Space Affairs in the U.S. Department of State. But he
  always returned to the skilled and productive use of electromagnetics to
  explore the universe — a task that his associates recall that he not only
  wanted to do, but to do well.</p>
