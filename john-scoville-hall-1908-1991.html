      <h1>John Scoville Hall (1908-1991)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>John Scoville Hall, director emeritus of the Lowell Observatory, died of
  heart failure on October 15, 1991, at his home in Sedona, Arizona. Hall was
  born in Old Lyme, Connecticut, the son of Nathaniel and Harriet Hall.
  Nathaniel Hall was a farmer and candy manufacturer; Mrs. Hall was a graduate
  of Wellesley College. John Hall attended Morgan High School; but apparently
  had little contact with astronomy until his sophomore year at Amherst College
  where he enrolled in an astronomy course taught by Warren K. Green. Hall's
  serious interest in astronomy began with this encounter. He accompanied Green
  to an AAS meeting at Columbia University during his junior year; and, when
  Hall was a senior, Green helped him obtain a scholarship for graduate study at
  Yale University.</p>

  <p>Hall studied at Yale under Frank Schlesinger, Dirk Brouwer, and Jan Schilt
  from 1930 to 1933. His Ph.D. thesis concerned near-infrared photometric
  measurements of stars using a photoelectric cell custom built by C. Holden
  Prescott of Bell Labs. Taking his cue from Prescott, Hall was the first to
  cool a photocell with dry ice to reduce the dark current to a sufficiently low
  level that astronomical measurements were possible. The results of John Hall's
  thesis and an excellent description of his photometric apparatus are found in
  <em>Ap.J.</em> <strong>79</strong>, 145, 1934.</p>

  <p>Following graduate study, Hall moved to Columbia University for a year and
  then on to Swarthmore. During his second year at Swarthmore, he married Ruth
  Chandler, whom he had met while still at Yale. The Halls ultimately had two
  children: Richard, who is currently an astronomer at Northern Arizona
  University in Flagstaff, and Carolyn Smith, who resides in Sedona.</p>

  <p>Throughout his career, John Hall's research centered around the use of
  photoelectric techniques. He was the first to use a photocell to scan stellar
  spectra (<em>Ap.J.</em> <strong>84</strong>, 369,1936) and the first to use a
  wire grating to isolate spectral regions for relative photoelectric
  spectrophotometry (<em>Ap.J.</em> <strong>94</strong>, 71, 1941). His work
  extended knowledge of the wavelength dependence of interstellar absorption out
  to approximately 1 micron. In 1949, John Hall and Albert Hiltner discovered
  the polarization of starlight by the interstellar medium (<em>Science</em>
  <strong>109</strong>, 165, 1949). Polarization measurements of a wide variety
  of objects ranging from galaxies to the Moon occupied much of John Hall's
  research for the remainder of his career. He also worked with Merle Tuve, Kent
  Ford, and William Baum in the development of the Carnegie image tube, a device
  which was widely used as an intensified imaging detector prior to the advent
  of CCDs.</p>

  <p>In 1938, Hall returned to his alma mater, Amherst College, where he
  continued his research and, for a time, operated a lab in which he built his
  own photocells. Then, following the outbreak of World War II the Hall family
  moved in 1942 to Cambridge, where John participated in the development of
  search and height-finding radars at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. His book,
  <em>Radar Aids to Navigation</em>, was published by McGraw Hill in 1947.
  Returning to Amherst in 1946, he taught physics for two years. This interval
  was the only time in his career that Hall assumed the role of a teacher.</p>

  <p>In 1948, John Hall became director of the Equatorial Division of the U. S.
  Naval Observatory in Washington, D. C. Much of his early work on polarization
  of starlight was done in Washington with the USNO's 40-inch telescope.
  However, because observing conditions were so poor at this urban, low-altitude
  site, Hall suggested that the telescope be moved to a more favorable location.
  He ultimately selected a site west of Flagstaff, Arizona, and the telescope
  was moved there in 1955. The Flagstaff Station of the U. S. Naval Observatory,
  which Hall founded, is now also the home of the Navy's 61-inch Astrometric
  Reflector.</p>

  <p>Hall was appointed director of Lowell Observatory in 1958. He remained in
  this position for 19 years, during which time he guided the Observatory
  through an unprecedented expansion in facilities and a notable strengthening
  of the research staff. Relocation of the 69-inch Perkins Reflector from
  Delaware, Ohio, to Lowell's newly established dark-sky site at Anderson Mesa
  was instigated by Hall. Also during his tenure, the Planetary Research Center
  was founded at Lowell with NASA sponsorship. In 1970, a versatile new 42-inch
  telescope was installed at Anderson Mesa—a telescope that twenty years later
  was renamed the John S. Hall Telescope in honor of the former director. These
  three major additions to the Observatory's research arsenal are only a few of
  the facilities now in operation at Lowell which date from the time of Dr.
  Hall's directorship. Roger Lowell Putnam, for forty years trustee of Lowell
  Observatory, noted in a 1968 letter to his director "It (Lowell Observatory)
  has become under your leadership a growing and viable force in astronomy,
  which it had ceased to be when you first became director." The last phrase of
  this statement is perhaps a bit harsh, but the overall sentiment of Putnam's
  message is true.</p>

  <p>John Hall was a friendly, gentle man who usually had a smile on his lips
  and a twinkle in his eye. He was always ready with a word of encouragement or
  a helpful idea. When a new staff astronomer at Lowell Observatory clumsily
  broke one of the director's photomultipliers, Dr. Hall simply told the young
  man, "If you never make mistakes, you aren't doing anything."</p>

  <p>Hall was an athletic person who at Amherst was a member of championship
  soccer and track teams. In fact, his 1929 pole-vaulting record of 11 feet 7
  inches stood at the college for several years. Throughout his life, he was
  also an accomplished tennis player and sailor. His wit and good humor are well
  illustrated by a sailing incident which occurred near the end of Hall's tenure
  at Lowell Observatory. Most summers, Dr. and Mrs. Hall would return to the
  Hall family farm at the mouth of the Connecticut River near Old Lyme. Hall and
  his brother maintained a sailboat there. One day, Lowell astronomer Nat White
  and family were visiting the Halls at the farm, and John was preparing to take
  them for a sail. Hall was boarding the boat, Nat inquired "How deep is it
  here?" At that moment, Hall lost his balance and tumbled overboard. He
  emerged, standing with the water level near his waist, and calmly replied,
  "About this deep!"</p>

  <p>As director, Dr. Hall opened the facilties of Lowell Observatory to
  astronomers from around the world. He took particular pleasure in introducing
  visiting observers from the cloud-shrouded climes of Europe, Scandinavia, and
  Scotland to the clear, dark skies of northern Arizona. Aina Elvius, Krysztof
  Serkowski, Mikolaj Jerzykiewicz, Alois Purgathofer, Karl Rakos, Tomas
  Pettauer, David Clarke, Ian McLean, and a string of Scandinavian graduate
  students came to Lowell for extended stays at Hall's invitation. These
  individuals, together with a steady stream of astronomers from Ohio State
  University, the Carnegie Institution, the U. S. Naval Observatory, and
  elsewhere, helped produce a vibrant astronomical community in Flagstaff. Most
  of this increased activity is traceable in one way or another to the
  initiatives of John Hall.</p>

  <p>In the course of his long career, Hall was a councilor of the American
  Astronomical Society from 1959 to 1962 and vice president of the Society from
  1963 to 1965. He served as president of Commission 16 and vice president of
  Commission 9 of the International Astronomical Union and was on the Space
  Sciences Board of the National Academy of Sciences for two years. Hall also
  served on NASA's Lunar and Planetary Missions Board. Amherst College, Ohio
  Wesleyan University, and Northern Arizona University each awarded honorary
  doctorates to John Hall.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of Hall's astronomical career, he became increasingly
  concerned with social and environmental issues. He experimented with the
  development of inexpensive, easily constructed solar water heaters for use on
  nearby Indian reservations. He also conducted a long series of measurements of
  horizontal extinction with the objective of establishing a baseline against
  which any subsequent deterioration of visibility due to increasing coal-fired
  production of electricity in northern Arizona could be measured. After
  retirement, John Hall maintained an active interest in things astronomical. He
  presented historical papers on the work of V. M. Slipher, John A. Miller, A.
  James Robertson, George Ritchey, and Henri Chrétien at meetings of the
  American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.
  Hall served as an honored and valued member of the Lowell Observatory Advisory
  Board until his death.</p>

  <p>Those of us who knew John Hall were privileged. He taught us by example the
  true meaning of the word "gentleman."</p>
