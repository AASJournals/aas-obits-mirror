  <p>Conrad R. Sturch, an astronomer and dedicated churchman, died June 13, 2014
  at Charlestown Retirement Community in Catonsville, Maryland. He was 76.</p>
  
  <p>Conrad Ray Sturch was born in Cincinnati, OH on November 5, 1937 to
  Reverend Ray C. Sturch, a tent-maker pastor, and Esther C. Sturch, an artist
  and homemaker. He attended public schools in several towns in southwestern
  Ohio as his father moved from parish to parish. He graduated from Milton-Union
  High School in 1955.</p>

  <p>He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in math
  and physics from Miami University of Ohio (Oxford, OH) in 1958 and received
  his Master of Science in physics from Miami U. in 1960. He was elected to Pi
  Mu Epsilon, Sigma Pi Sigma, and Phi Beta Kappa honoraries. He relocated to the
  University of California at Berkeley to pursue a doctorate in astronomy which
  he completed in 1965. He was a member of Sigma Xi. While living in Berkeley he
  met his future wife, Sharon Hocker, singing together in a local church choir.
  They married in September of 1962.</p>

  <p>Dr. Sturch’s first teaching
  appointment was at the University of Rochester (NY) in the Physics and
  Astronomy Department, where he also continued his research on red-shifting of
  galaxies. In 1973 he and his family moved to London, Ontario (Canada) where he
  taught at the University of Western Ontario for one year, then to Clemson
  University (SC) for two years.</p>

  <p>In 1976 he accepted an offer from
  Computer Sciences Corporation to join in support of the HEAO orbiting
  observatories mission under contract with NASA and moved to Rockville, MD. He
  wrote part of the proposal to NASA that resulted in the location of the Space
  Telescope Science Institute at the Johns Hopkins Homewood Campus and in 1981
  he started his 21-year span of service at the Institute. He was a co-author of
  both Guide Star Catalogs developed for use by the Hubble Space Telescope and
  subsequent orbiting and ground-based telescopes. He retired from CSC and STScI
  in 2002.</p>

  <p>In retirement he volunteered with the pastors of his
  church, St. John’s United Church of Christ in Catonsville, for outreach
  services to St. Elizabeth and Brightview retirement facilities. For 25 years
  he sang in his church’s choir and a small a capella ensemble, and occasionally
  played piano for Sunday services.</p>

  <p>Survivors include his wife of 51
  years, his daughter Kathryn Sturch of San Diego, CA, a great aunt in Arkansas
  and numerous cousins in the Midwest.</p>
