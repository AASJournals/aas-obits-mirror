      <h1>Pierre Lacroute (1906-1993)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Pierre Lacroute passed away on 14 January 1993, a few days before reaching
  the age of 87. In 1946, shortly after the end of World War II, he was
  appointed Director of Strasbourg (France) Astronomical Observatory (succeeding
  André Danjon who was then taking up the directorship of Paris Observatory).
  Pierre Lacroute stayed in this position until his retirement in 1976. During
  the same period, he was also Professor at the Faculty of Sciences of
  Strasbourg Louis Pasteur University. He served also as Dean of this
  Faculty.</p>

  <p>Pierre Lacroute will be remembered as a pioneer of space astrometry.
  Already in 1967, he was proposing an original technique based on the
  measurement of large angles from a space telescope. He refined this idea and
  finally got support from the European Space Agency. The Hipparcos satellite
  was born. Launched in 1989, Hipparcos initially encountered difficulties
  in achieving a correct orbit. Nowadays though, this satellite has completed
  its task of collecting data of an outstanding quality that will lead to a deep
  revision of the distance scale in the Universe. Astronomers from all over the
  world are participating in the programs of this satellite.</p>

  <p>It would be a mistake to reduce Pierre Lacroute’s career to this single
  Hipparcos project, since his entire life was devoted to the development of
  measurement techniques of stellar positions and velocities. At the beginning
  of the 1970s, he also welcomed in his Observatory the Strasbourg Astronomical
  Data Centre (CDS) whose database SIMBAD is now serving the world astronomical
  community.</p>

  <p>I came personally to know Pierre Lacroute around that time since I started
  my professional astronomical life with Jean Jung, first CDS Director. I was
  always impressed by his kindness, although he was molded in the old-style,
  somewhat authoritative, managerial approach, so typical of the elder
  generation. He never missed an opportunity to discuss his ideas (scientific or
  general), as well as his space projects such as Hipparcos, with young people,
  including the foreign visitor and beginner I was at the time. His famous
  “Comment dirais-je…” (“How could I say…”) will remain in the ears of all those
  who talked to him.</p>

  <p>He was originally from Burgundy, a region he loved and where he has now
  been buried. He was a father of a large happy family. Pierre Lacroute was
  honored by several French distinctions and prizes, and it was fitting the he
  lived long enough after his retirement to see his brainchild Hipparcos
  successfully operational.</p>
