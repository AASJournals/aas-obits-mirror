      <h1>Julius H. Cahn (1919-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Julius H. Cahn, researcher on variable stars and planetary nebulae, died 29
  July 2009 in Santa Fe at age 89. He was born 29 October 1919 in Chicago,
  Illinois, the eldest son of Morton D. Cahn and Elizabeth Hofeller Cahn, and
  grew up in Winnetka, Illinois. Cahn received his bachelors degree in 1942 from
  Yale University. During World War II, he worked at Camp Evans Signal
  Laboratory, Belmar, New Jersey, and later at the University of California
  Berkeley, before serving with the U.S. Army in Europe in 1944. Cahn obtained
  his PhD in 1948 from Yale University, completing a thesis titled “The Effects
  of Electrostatic Interactions on the Electronic Velocity Distribution
  Function.” After completing graduate school, he taught physics at the
  University of Nebraska (1948-50), spent eight years at the Battelle Memorial
  Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and twenty-six years at the University of
  Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, most of that time in the Astronomy Department. His
  research focus was on Mira variables and planetary nebulae. His most cited
  paper during his Illinois tenure was “The Distances and Distribution of
  Planetary Nebulae,” with James Kaler, which listed the photometric distances,
  or upper limits to the distances, of more than 600 planetary nebulae
  (<i>Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series</i> 22 (1971)).</p>

  <p>Cahn retired in 1985, and he and his wife, Helen Blackhall Cahn, moved to
  Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1992. He was a skillful amateur pianist and also
  played the bass and cello, both solo and with others. He loved cars and
  motorcycles, and was certified to fly single-engine and twin-engine airplanes,
  with his wife frequently serving as co-pilot. In his later years, Cahn took up
  weightlifting and competed in weightlifting meets.</p>
