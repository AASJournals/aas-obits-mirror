  <p>Longtime Harvard Curator of Astronomical Photographs and AAVSO officer
  Martha Hazen passed away on 23 December 2006 at Hingham, Massachusetts, after
  a short illness due to acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>

  <p>One of four children of Harold Locke and Katherine (neé Salisbury) Hazen,
  Martha was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 15 July 1931, and raised in
  the Town of Belmont, near Cambridge, where she lived for most of her life. Her
  father coined the term "servo-mechanism" while serving as an engineering
  professor and dean for graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology. Her mother majored in chemistry at Mount Holyoke College.</p>

  <p>After receiving an A.B. in astronomy from Mount Holyoke College in 1953,
  Martha earned a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1958 from the University of Michigan,
  defending a dissertation on the distribution of intensity in elliptical
  galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Martha's marriage to William Liller in 1959,
  and the births of two children, inevitably slowed down her progress in
  observational astronomy. As a research fellow of the Harvard College
  Observatory, Martha continued to observe two to three weeks a year in Chile,
  and to reduce those observations and publish the results for sixteen
  years.</p>

  <p>Martha's first publication, at least as far as Astrophysics Data System
  includes the literature, was with Alice Farnsworth on the 1952 occultations of
  stars by the Moon, published in the Astronomical Journal (1953). In 1958 she
  joined L. R. Doherty and D. H. Menzel on a short note about the calculation of
  line profiles in a stratified atmosphere, her only theory paper.</p>

  <p>Martha's most cited paper is "The Distribution of Intensity in Elliptical
  Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster," (ApJ, 132, p.306, 1960). There she
  acknowledges Allan Sandage for suggesting the problem and providing some of
  the data. Her second most cited paper is "Photometric histories of QSOs - Two
  QSOs with large light amplitude," (Liller, M. H. &amp; Liller, W., ApJ
  (Letters), 199, p. L133-L135, 1975). Progressing to smaller objects, other
  frequently cited papers are on eta Carinae and spectroscopic binaries in the
  globular cluster M3. All of these, and most of her other papers, involve
  photographic photometry, mostly using archival data.</p>

  <p>In 1969, Harvard appointed Martha Curator of Astronomical Photographs,
  placing her in responsible charge of the world renowned Harvard Plate
  Archives. Under attack during the mid-1950s because it occupied too much
  physical space, the collection had been neglected for over a decade when
  Martha assumed this additional responsibility. Though she continued to observe
  for a few years thereafter, her stewardship of the invaluable plate archives
  gradually demanded her full attention, which it held until her retirement in
  2002.</p>

  <p>In her thirty-three years as curator of the plate stacks, as the archive is
  popularly known, Martha made numerous friends in both the professional and
  amateur communities. Astronomical researchers on a wide variety of topics
  relied on her detailed knowledge of the collection to guide them to important
  discoveries or discovery confirmations on the old plates, and to historical
  understanding of results in which some detail of origin needed clarification.
  Martha researched and documented the characteristics of nearly a hundred
  separate telescopic cameras used to take the plates archived in the
  collection. Much of this information was ephemeral, having been passed orally
  from observer to observer and was in danger of passing from human memory. This
  was, in itself, an enormous and valuable undertaking as it ensures the utility
  of the plates for future research. More importantly, Martha conserved and
  catalogued the all important logbooks that record the date, time, and other
  exposure circumstances for each of the plates in the collection. The full
  measure of Martha's long-term contribution in this regard undoubtedly will be
  realized as the digitization of the entire collection of plates is completed.
  The Digital Access to a Sky Century from Harvard (DASCH) project will owe much
  to Martha's efforts in this regard.</p>

  <p>Another important contribution to progress in astronomy from the plate
  stacks came as Martha engaged in what she called Forensic Astronomy. Over the
  years, a great many variable stars that had been discovered on the Harvard
  plates had since been "lost," i. e. could not be found or verified. At the
  request of Nikolai Samus, General Editor of the General Catalogue of Variable
  Stars (GCVS), Martha found the original discovery plates on these stars
  together with sufficient relevant information from other sources, and was
  successful in re-establishing credible identifications and accurate
  coordinates for 1,174 of the nearly 1,200 "lost" variable stars on the GCVS
  list. This required looking at multiple plates of the field involved to sort
  out whether the problem was an erroneous identification, inappropriate
  coordinates for the star, or some other problem. Many astronomers,
  professional and amateur, have relied on Martha to teach them the now arcane
  skills of photovisual photometry using a time series of plates and a "fly
  swatter" to discover variable stars, confirm a period or period change, or
  simply to construct a historical light curve to fit with modern
  observations.</p>

  <p>The range of co-authors on Martha's many publications illustrates how
  useful her chosen specialization was to the field. She served as a portal to
  otherwise difficult-to-access but very valuable (and irreplaceable) data,
  particularly the Harvard Plate Collection.</p>

  <p>In the 1970s, when interest in improving the status of women in astronomy
  arose, along with the desire to recruit more women into astronomy, Martha was
  appointed as Harvard College Observatory's representative to a university-wide
  coordination committee on the status of women in university life generally.
  Working with Ursula Marvin, who had similar responsibilities for the
  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Martha played a leadership role in the
  field for several years, helping to organize the first Space for Women
  conference in 1975.</p>

  <p>Martha's long term support for the American Association of Variable Star
  Observers (AAVSO) was a natural consequence of her earlier work as an
  observational astronomer as well as curator of the plate stacks. She joined
  AAVSO in 1975, and was first elected to the Council in 1984, became a vice
  president, and eventually became president in 1992. When long-term AAVSO
  secretary Clinton Banker Ford (obituary, BAAS, 26, p. 1602-1603, 1994) passed
  away in February 1993, Martha was elected secretary to replace Ford, and
  served in that capacity for over ten years. Her services to AAVSO went well
  beyond those years in elective offices, however, and cannot be fully
  understood only in those terms. Martha also served a vital role as a friend
  and mentor for Janet Akyüz Mattei ((obituary, BAAS, 36, p. 1681-1682, 2004)
  throughout the latter's tenure as the director of AAVSO. The proximity of the
  plate stacks and AAVSO offices made it convenient for them to spend frequent
  lunch hours together, almost invariably discussing problems in administering
  the AAVSO. Both the authors of this obituary can testify, as former AAVSO
  presidents, to the importance of Martha's support and advice for Janet, and to
  the importance of her role behind the scenes in AAVSO activities for many
  years. AAVSO honored Martha for this service by presenting her their 37th
  Merit Award.</p>

  <p>After her first marriage ended in divorce in 1982, Martha married Bruce
  McHenry, a retired career professional from the National Park Service, in
  1991. That their relationship was a happy and fulfilling one is attested by
  the many friends Bruce made among Martha's astronomical associates. Their
  extensive travel together frequently involved Bruce's continuing professional
  interest in natural-history interpretation, but also touched many astronomical
  bases. Their travels also took the happy couple to the sites of many old
  canals, an interest they shared, as well as to quilting exhibitions, another
  of Martha's many interests. Martha's life long contributions to astronomy were
  recognized by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory colleagues through the
  naming of an asteroid, (10024) Marthahazen in her honor. She is survived by
  Bruce; three siblings, Stanley Hazen, Nathen Hazen, and Anne Bowen; her son,
  John Liller and daughter, Hilary Ward; and five grandchildren.</p>
