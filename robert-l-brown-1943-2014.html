  <p>Robert Lamme Brown was born on August 17, 1943 in Los Angeles, California,
  the middle son of three born to John R. and Vonne L. Brown. He was raised in
  Inglewood, California, and graduated from the University of California at
  Berkeley in 1965. After graduation he married his high school sweetheart,
  Karen Lynne Dobson. They had three children, Kendra, Lori, and Garrick. He may
  have been influenced in his choice of a Ph.D. research topic by his experience
  working in Kinsey Anderson’s cosmic ray research group as an undergraduate. He
  was awarded a Ph.D. in 1969 by the University of California at San Diego,
  where he worked under Robert J. Gould. His thesis, Interstellar Absorption of
  Cosmic X-rays [Phys. Rev. D, 1, 2252 1970], was on a topic of considerable
  interest during the pioneering years of x-ray astronomy. The American
  Institute of Physics noted that it was one of the 100 most cited papers in
  astronomy and physics during the 1970s.</p>

  <p>In 1969 Brown began his
  distinguished career in radio astronomy as a postdoctoral fellow at the
  National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). Although trained as a theorist,
  he quickly became a skilled observer. His management skills did not go
  unnoticed, and by the time he left the NRAO to become the Director of the
  National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) in 2003, he had served as the
  site director of the NRAO’s Green Bank and Tucson facilities, Director of the
  MMA Project, and NRAO Deputy Director.</p>

  <p>One of Brown’s most
  significant scientific achievements was the discovery with Bruce Balick of the
  compact radio source at the center of the Galaxy. On February 13 &amp; 15,
  1974, a combination of the NRAO Green Bank Interferometer with a 45-foot
  antenna in Huntersville, West Virginia, provided enough resolution and
  sensitivity to detect the faint, compact source. Later, Brown named the source
  Sgr A*. It has since been shown to be coincident with the center of the Milky
  Way, driven by a massive black hole. The discovery was a fundamental advance
  in our understanding of galactic nuclei. He was also an expert on radio
  recombination lines, writing with Jay Lockman and Gillian Knapp the review
  that remains the standard on the subject.</p>

  <p>Brown also had an
  interest in extra-galactic astronomy, particularly, the detection of spectral
  lines in high redshift objects. With Morton Roberts he made the first
  detection of HI in absorption (z~0.7) against a quasar, 3C286 (z~0.8). Several
  more such detections followed. Today, HI absorption searches are a major
  science driver for the Square Kilometer Array. It was this experience that led
  him to search for CO emission from the hyper-luminous infrared galaxy
  F10214+4724. The detection, with Paul Vanden Bout, of the CO(3-2) rotational
  line extended by a factor of more than 10 the redshift of previous CO emission
  detections in infrared-rich galaxies. It was a major motivation for the
  construction of the Millimeter Array (MMA), which later evolved into the
  Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA).</p>

  <p>Brown’s
  aptitude for doing several things at once served him well in his various
  management roles at the NRAO. He could write effortlessly and as Deputy
  Director was responsible for drafting the many program plans, long range
  plans, and reports that the National Science Foundation (NSF) required in ever
  increasing numbers over the years. He was a patient person, well suited to
  participate in the negotiations of, for example, the agreements with the
  Soviet Union and Japan for NRAO support of space VLBI, the merger of the MMA
  with the European Large Southern Array into ALMA, and the frequently
  contentious process that determined the NRAO investment for the year in new
  instrumentation. He had the perseverance required during the many years it
  took to realize MMA development funding for organizing workshops, conferences,
  and keeping the project alive. He was adventurous and liked to travel; he was
  the first person from the NRAO to see the future ALMA site in the high Andean
  altiplano above the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. He immediately
  recognized its potential and initiated site testing. The site has been
  critical to the stunning success of ALMA. Indeed, the success of ALMA owes as
  much to Brown’s efforts in many areas of the project as to anyone.</p>

  <p>Brown was eager to work with young people, consistently supervising NRAO
  summer students and mentoring postdoctoral fellows. He supervised five
  graduate students in their Ph.D. research at the University of Virginia: W. S.
  Gilmore, A. P. Marscher, F. H. Levinson, S. G. Neff, and D. T. Frayer. He was
  a member of the American Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical
  Union, and the International Union of Radio Science.</p>

  <p>In 2003, Brown
  became the Director of the NAIC and its principal facility – the Arecibo
  Observatory. Commuting between Cornell University, the NSF contractor for the
  operation of the NAIC, and the Arecibo Telescope’s site in Puerto Rico, Brown
  made many improvements to the operation of the observatory. He retired in
  2008. He found an outlet in retirement for his energy by opening with Karen an
  ice cream parlor in Corolla, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where the
  family residence was located after they left Charlottesville, Virginia. In his
  own words, his role in the shop was “Chief Financial Officer and Head of
  Janitorial Services”.</p>

  <p>Brown was devoted to his family, particularly
  his children and grandchildren, for whom he was always buying souvenirs on his
  travels. He died suddenly of a heart attack in Florence, South Carolina, while
  travelling to Disney World to spend time with his grandchildren. He was a very
  friendly, outgoing, and well-liked person. His infectious laughter was a
  cheering presence in the halls of the NRAO. He is missed by his family,
  friends, and colleagues.</p>
