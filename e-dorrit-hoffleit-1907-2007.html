<div>
  <p>For Ellen Dorrit Hoffleit, who died on 9 April 2007 in New Haven,
  Connecticut, shortly after her 100th birthday, World War II, in which she did
  at least her fair share of the work, was "the war," but she also lived through
  World War I ("the Great War" until she was well into her 30s), Korea, Vietnam,
  the first Gulf War, and (we hope) most of Iraq.</p>

  <p>Hoffleit's early years were difficult, and she described her own life as
  having led "From Early Sadness to Happy Old Age" (Comments on Astrophysics,
  18, p. 107, 1996), with a late autobiography entitled Misfortunes as Blessing
  in Disguise(American Association of Variable Star Astronomers, 2002). The name
  Dorrit came from Dickens, but her parents, who called her Dorchen in
  childhood, were German immigrants, and some of her classmates refused to play
  with her "because she's German!" Home oscillated between a failing farm in
  Florence, Alabama, where she was born on 12 March 1907 and rented space in the
  railroad town of New Castle, Pennsylvania, where her father was a bookkeeper
  for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Older brother, Herbert (1905-1981) was, perhaps
  inevitably, the favored child, a precocious student (Harvard PhD at 22) and
  devoted to that most respectable subject, Latin language and literature, of
  which he was a professor at UCLA from 1927 (when it was the Southern Branch of
  the University of California) until his retirement. He took the teaching part
  of his career more seriously than the research part (though he was not the
  most memorable of the three Latin professors I had there), but, at a time when
  Dorrit's publications outnumbered Herbert's by something like fifty to one,
  she remarked, a little sadly, that the only thing about her that her mother,
  who lived until 1974, really approved of was her long hair.</p>

  <p>Dorrit soon started catching up! She was the only member of the Radcliffe
  class of 1928 who had taken a graduate course in mathematics. She turned down
  a better paying job as a statistician to start work the next year as a
  research assistant (later research associate) at Harvard College Observatory,
  then directed by Harlow Shapley, about whom her opinion was much warmer than
  that expressed by Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin. Dorrit's immediate supervisor at
  Harvard was Henrietta Swope, daughter of the President of General Electric,
  and eventually best known for work at Mount Wilson Observatory with Walter
  Baade on variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds, published in papers that
  continued to appear long after Baade's death.</p>

  <p>Hoffleit's first ten papers were also on variable stars and appeared in
  Harvard Observatory publications. But the MA she completed in 1932 was on the
  light curves of meteors and was published in the Proceedings of the United
  States National Academy of Sciences. By this time, Dorrit had established a
  work pattern that was to persist right up to retirement - at least 40 hours
  per week on whatever the current boss thought she should be doing, and another
  20 or so on other astronomical research that interested her.</p>

  <p>Hoffleit had supposed that an MA would be her highest degree, but Shapley
  urged her to go on for a PhD, with, it would seem, a bit of urging on both
  sides from Bart Bok, who informed her that "if God recommends that you do
  something, it is your duty to do it." The thesis (PhD 1938) was on yet a third
  topic, spectroscopic parallaxes. This means determining the luminosities of
  stars, hence their distances, from line width and ratio diagnostics in their
  spectra. The pioneer was Antonia Maury, whose insights were not appreciated by
  Shapley's predecessor, E. C. Pickering. Another valuable Hoffleit mentor was
  Ernst Öpik, on a three-month visit to Harvard in 1934, from whom Dorrit
  learned stellar statistics and half a dozen other things. The thesis also
  provided her "break out" paper into the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> (on CN
  as a giant/dwarf discriminator).</p>

  <p>Hoffleit began to branch out into astrometry, comets, and other parts of
  astronomy and, starting in 1941, began writing about eighty short news notes
  per year for Volumes 1-15 of the newly formed <em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em>.
  And then there was a war. Women were not, of course, drafted nor required to
  find state-side war work to avoid deployment overseas, but Dorrit, still
  mindful of her German heritage, volunteered. After about six months working
  under Zdenek Kopal on preparation of firing tables for Navy cannons, she
  returned briefly to Harvard, having been employed (and paid) at roughly the
  high-school student level by the Navy. But soon it was on to the Ballistic
  Research Laboratory of the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground and another
  computing job, this time for trajectories of anti-aircraft missiles. The other
  job opportunity was to measure missile tracks on photographic plates, which
  she would have preferred, but this would have placed her in the department
  headed by Edwin P. Hubble. No love was lost between Harvard's Shapley and
  Mount Wilson's Hubble, partly due to scientific differences, but also partly
  due to their very different views on what scientists should do in war time, so
  perhaps is was just as well she ended up in the computing section. There was
  another stage of fuss and bother to be got through before Dorrit received an
  appropriate, "professional" (meaning with PhD) rank and the commensurate
  salary. To the Colonel who complained that women were forever leaving their
  jobs to get married, she mentioned only her age, and not her early resolve
  never to marry or to have children, because of a deep worry that they might
  inherit the mental instability that had led to her maternal grandmother's
  institutionalization and early death.</p>

  <p>By the end of the war, her position, salary, and responsibilities a good
  match to her skills and credentials, Dorrit willingly put in another three
  years with the Army, working on reduction of records of "Doppler Velocity and
  Position" data for the captured V-2s being flown from White Sands Missile
  Range. But it was not the astronomy she loved, and late 1948 saw her back at
  Harvard (though with a consultant's appointment at Aberdeen for another ten
  years), salary cut back by a factor two, but with tenure as an astronomer, a
  bigger office, and an enormous pile of plates from the Blömfontein station to
  be measured for spectroscopic parallaxes. She undertook that and a wide range
  of other projects, with full support from above as long as Shapley was
  director.</p>

  <p>It must mean something that the next director, Donald H. Menzel, who
  eventually precipitated Hoffleit's departure from Harvard, had also been born
  in a Florence (Colorado, rather than Alabama), but what really mattered was
  that he wanted to move Harvard in the direction of his own field of
  astrophysics and saw no good reason to maintain extensive plate files or
  people who extracted data from them.</p>

  <p>Dorrit went job hunting, and, when the dust had finally settled, she was
  ensconced in two positions that she would occupy officially for the next
  twenty years (and unofficially long beyond that). It was in those two contexts
  that most of us came to know her. Hoffleit became, half-and-half, both
  director of the Maria Mitchell Observatory from 1957 to 1978 and a research
  astronomer at Yale (1956 to official 1975 retirement) under its long-term
  director Dirk Brouwer, where her primary task was to be preparation of
  astrometric catalogs.</p>

  <p>The Observatory directorship first. Maria Mitchell (MMO) was (and is) a
  small, private observatory on Nantucket Island (Massachusetts) founded as a
  memorial to the first woman astronomer in the USA by her family and friends.
  The primary instrument was a 7.5" refractor used (1912-1995) primarily for
  photographic monitoring of variable stars. Hoffleit proposed to work on some
  hundreds of her Harvard discoveries, employing for the first time during each
  summer a small group of undergraduate women to acquire additional plates,
  measure them, determine periods, and so forth, the results eventually to be
  published, often in the Journal of the American Association of Variable Star
  Observers, where MMO papers still turn up, though perhaps not so many as in
  Dorrit's day. She would also continue education and public outreach activities
  in the local community that her predecessor, Margaret Harwood, had
  established.</p>

  <p>Summer research experience for undergraduate opportunities have become
  common, but they were rare in 1957, especially for women students, and the
  ones who came to MMO (more than one hundred over her term) were undoubtedly
  very strongly motivated. They left even more so, with the striking result that
  about 25 of the Hoffleit students became professional astronomers. A few of
  the earliest are now retired; many remain in stellar astronomy, but others
  have spread across the Solar System and the galaxies. According to a list
  compiled by Dorrit, with minor additions, these are, in chronological order:
  Margo Friedel Aller, Andrea Knudsen Dupree, Barbara Welther, Gretchen Luft
  Hagen Harris, Nancy Houk, Martha Safford Hanner, Diane Reeve Moorhead, Nancy
  Remage Evans, Catherine Doremus Garmany, Jane Turner, Jean Warren Goad, Karen
  Alper Castle, Marcia Keyes Rieke, Judy Karpen, Karen Kwitter, Esther Hu,
  Bonnie Buratti, Harriet Dinerstein, Melissa McGrath, Constance Phillips
  Walker, John Briggs, Deborah Crocker, Edward Morgan, and Karen Meech. (The
  program went co-ed shortly before Dorrit handed it over to Emilia
  Belserene).</p>

  <p>A special paragraph must go to Janet Akyüz Mattei. She came to MMO in the
  summer of 1969 upon the recommendation of Paris Pismis, an
  Armenian-Turkish-Mexican astronomer who had known Janet in Turkey and was a
  very old friend of Dorrit's (and of mine). Janet's own obituary sadly appeared
  in these pages (<em>BAAS</em>, 36, pp. 1681-82, 2004), the last 30 of her only
  61 years having been spent as the director of AAVSO. Among the many important
  things Janet did in that directorial capacity was to persuade Dorrit Hoffleit
  to write up the story of her life for publication by AAVSO in 2002, from which
  much of this material has been taken.</p>

  <p>And then there was Yale. "Dorrit Hoffleit?" "You know. The Yale Bright Star
  Catalogue." Indeed the Yale Bright Star Catalogue: the Third (1964) edition on
  her own; the Fourth (1982) with Carlos Jaschek; the 1983 Supplement; and the
  Fifth (1987) edition with W. H. Warren. The value of these would be hard to
  overestimate. They were cited one hundred or more times per year from 1985 to
  1999 (compared, to about twenty citations per year to Annie J. Cannon's HD
  catalogues and about 600 per year to the multiplet tables of Charlotte E.
  Moore during the same period). But there were also her contributions to a
  number of other Yale catalogues of positions and proper motions, and,
  especially, the 4th edition of the General Catalogue of Trigonometric
  Parallaxes with W. F. van Altena and J. T. Lee, plus a large number of papers
  based on subsets of the stars in these catalogues and compilations.</p>

  <p>Dirk Brouwer, who had chaired the search committee that selected Hoffleit
  as director of Maria Mitchell, was also department head and observatory
  director at Yale when she arrived there. Late in 2006, when Dorrit had become
  even more forthcoming than in her autobiography, she admitted in an extended
  phone conversation that he had been a very traditional director, not just
  primarily committed to positional astronomy (one of her own loves) but also of
  the opinion that the staff should work primarily on his projects. Yet the
  unexpected death of Brouwer in January 1966 could have been a disaster. The
  newly appointed acting director, Rupert Wildt (of H-minus opacity fame) made
  clear that the future of the department would lie with astrophysics, and he
  did some firm "deaccessioning" of non-tenured staff in celestial mechanics and
  astrometry. But when Pierre Demarque took up the chairmanship, making clear
  that it would not be for the rest of his life, he was very glad to have
  Hoffleit's programs continue and, in fact, gave her a good deal more freedom
  to choose then than had Brouwer.</p>

  <p>Dorrit used part of that freedom to begin writing about the history of
  astronomy, first book reviews and obituaries, but soon also articles on the
  history of variable star astronomy, a long 1993 article on women who had
  worked in the field (and she included supernovae!), and, most notably, the
  1992 volume Astronomy at Yale 1701-1968. Eventually her historical interests
  were bound to overlap her own lifetime, and her last publication was the
  written version of a talk she gave at the April 2000 meeting of the American
  Physical Society on the pioneering women of stellar classification - Fleming,
  Maury, and Cannon (Physics in Perspective, 4, pp. 367-495, 2002).</p>

  <p>Among the honors bestowed upon Hoffleit, primarily rather late in her life,
  were two DSc's (Smith College 1984, Central Connecticut State University
  1998), the George van Biesbroeck Prize (American Astronomical Society and
  University of Arizona, 1988) for extraordinary service to the astronomical
  community both as a mentor and as a cataloguer, and an asteroid (3416) in
  1987.</p>

  <p>With no children or grandchildren of her own, Dorrit established close
  relationships with her brother's two children, many of the Maria Mitchell
  "girls," and the children of her younger Yale colleague Robert Zinn. In a
  slightly more ideal world, this piece would have been written either by Janet
  Mattei of AAVSO or by Martha (Liller) Hazen, whose friendship with Dorrit went
  right back to the plate stacks of Harvard. Both predeceased her.</p>

  <p>Dorrit once said of Annie J. Cannon that she (AJC) was the happiest person
  that she (EDH) had ever known. I am not quite sure we can say that, in turn,
  about Dorrit Hoffleit, but she certainly was in the running. And part of what
  it made it so wonderful to encounter her was not just that you were glad to
  see her, but that she was glad to see you.</p>
