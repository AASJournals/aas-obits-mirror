  <p>Albert George Wilson supervised the National Geographic Society-Palomar
  Observatory Sky Survey, directed the Lowell Observatory, and was the founding
  co-editor of <em>Icarus</em>. His discoveries included four dwarf galaxies in
  the Local Group, several supernovae, a comet, and at least five asteroids. His
  main interest, however, was theoretical cosmology, especially the idea of
  discretization.</p>

  <p>The son of oil company geologist Arthur Rector Wilson and homemaker and
  writer Hazel Mildred Straw, Wilson was born in Houston, Texas on 28 July 1918,
  grew up in Denver, Colorado, and moved back to Houston with his family when he
  finished high school. He had decided at age five that he wanted to be an
  astronomer, but he attended Rice Institute (now University) in Houston, where
  he asked the president why there was no astronomy and was told that the damp,
  cloudy climate precluded it.</p>

  <p>Upon receiving his B.S. in electrical
  engineering in 1941, he entered graduate school at the California Institute of
  Technology—another institution that did not offer any astronomy—in
  mathematics. His graduate work was interrupted by two years in the U.S. Navy,
  installing radar on ships. He returned to Caltech to submit his thesis in 1947
  on an applied mathematics problem dealing with the spread of heat after a
  major impact. At this time he became a senior research fellow at Caltech and
  began work with Fritz Zwicky on the search for supernovae with the 18-inch
  Schmidt telescope. He would always feel close to Zwicky and his
  “morphological” approach to science.</p>

  <p>In 1948 Jesse Greenstein came
  to Caltech and founded the program in astronomy. Wilson, a staff member of
  both Caltech and the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories from 1949–1953,
  helped organize the astrophysics library and taught both undergraduate and
  graduate courses. He taught practical astronomy to graduate students,
  including Helmut Abt and Allan Sandage. He was put in charge of observations
  for the National Geographical Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, working
  under Ira S. Bowen. It was during this period that he and R.G. Harrington
  discovered Leo I and Leo II. Later, Wilson announced the discoveries of two
  more local group galaxies, the Draco and Ursa Minor Dwarfs. During this period
  Wilson began writing popular articles for such publications as <em>Scientific
  American</em> and <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>

  <p>Roger Lowell
  Putnam, sole trustee of Lowell Observatory, acting on the recommendation of
  astronomer John C. Duncan, approached Al Wilson about becoming director of the
  venerable institution. It had been moribund for decades with three aging staff
  members, director V.M.Slipher, his brother E.C. Slipher, and C.O. Lampland,
  dominating but doing little research. Lampland had died in 1951 and V.M. was
  ready to retire. Wilson was hired as assistant director effective 1 July 1953
  with the understanding that if all went well V.M. would retire and Wilson
  would succeed him after a year.</p>

  <p>Wilson served as director of Lowell
  Observatory from 11 November 1954 to 3 January 1957. It did not go well. There
  was a rebellion by the younger staff members, especially Harold Johnson and
  Henry Giclas, which led to his early resignation. Half a century later, Wilson
  recalled gratefully that his successor, John S. Hall, thanked him for doing
  much of the necessary “dirty work” to modernize the historic observatory.</p>

  <p>Despite constant battles with the staff, Wilson achieved quite a
  bit during his short tenure at Lowell. He hosted the first ever “Astrobiology
  Seminar” and began plans for a meeting of the Astronomical Society of the
  Pacific, began a survey for a new dark sky site, initiated seminar and guest
  investigator programs, and obtained outside support for several programs,
  including observations of a Mars opposition from South Africa and an eclipse
  from Sri Lanka. He also joined with Russell Morgan and Ralph Sturm of Johns
  Hopkins University to test their electronic image-orthicon intensifier,
  developed for medical uses, on planetary photography. He became interested
  in—and wrote about—Mars, astrobiology, and scintillation layers in the Earth’s
  atmosphere. He served on the Council of the American Astronomical Society and
  the Board of Trustees of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, both from
  1955 to 1958.</p>

  <p>Returning to southern California, Wilson worked as a
  senior member of the research staff at the Rand Corporation from 1957–1966.
  His work was supported by the U.S. Air Force, and he had plenty of time for
  his own research, which was in galaxies and cosmology. One of the visitors
  there was Zdenek Kopal, who wanted to start a journal of solar system studies,
  so the two of them founded <em>Icarus</em> in 1962 and jointly edited it for
  its first six years, after which they turned it over to Carl Sagan.</p>

  <p>It was at Rand that Wilson met mathematician Dominic G.B. Edelen, who
  shared his interest in the idea of discretization (now it would probably be
  called quantization) in astronomy. The two wrote several articles and a book
  together on the subject before and after Edelen went off to become a professor
  at Lehigh University. Their ideas have received little support.</p>

  <p>In
  1966, Wilson became associate director of the Douglas Advanced Research
  Laboratories. At Wilson’s instigation, the labs sponsored a 1968 symposium on
  Hierarchical Structures, the proceedings of which were edited by Lancelot Law
  Whyte, Wilson, and Wilson’s wife Donna.</p>

  <p>Wilson retired from Douglas
  in 1972 rather than move to St. Louis after the McDonnell-Douglas merger. He
  then taught astronomy and philosophy of science, including such courses as
  “Math, Myth, and Metaphor” as an adjunct professor at the University of
  Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

  <p>Wilson was married to Frances Malich from 1940 to 1957. They had four
  children. In 1961 he married Donna Scott, an editor and writer who coauthored
  some of his writings until her death in 1998.</p>

  <p>Wilson spent his last
  25 years studying Buddhist philosophy in Sebastopol, California, where he died
  27 August 2012. He noted that he had three things in common with Percival
  Lowell: both were primarily mathematicians, and both had interests in
  astronomy and in Eastern philosophy.</p>
