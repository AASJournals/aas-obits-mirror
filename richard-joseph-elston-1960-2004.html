  <p>Richard Joseph Elston, known for his development of innovative astronomical
  instrumentation, died on 26 January 2004 in Gainesville, Florida, after a
  four-year battle with Hodgkin's lymphoma. A professor of astronomy at the
  University of Florida, Richard had an unusually broad range of interests and
  skills, and a willingness to share his passion for astronomy with others,
  which made him a highly valued member of the astronomical community.</p>

  <p>Born 1 July 1960, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Richard was the son of a
  geologist father and journalist mother. His childhood interest in astronomy
  and instrumentation matured as he majored in physics and astronomy at the
  University of New Mexico (BS, 1983) under the mentorship of Michael Zeilik.
  Richard pursued his PhD in astronomy at the University of Arizona and earned
  his degree in 1988. He pioneered the use of IR arrays for deep imaging surveys
  of the sky to study galaxy formation, and completed his thesis "Search for
  Rapidly Forming Galaxies at High Redshift" under the direction of George
  Rieke. Richard's graduate work included the first detection of galaxies at
  intermediate redshifts with evolved populations too red to have been
  identifiable from optical imaging surveys alone. In the <em>Astrophysical
  Journal Letters</em> in 1988, he, George Rieke, and Marcia Rieke reported the
  discovery of this new class of galaxies, now known as EROs (Extremely Red
  Objects), important as the possible progenitors of present day elliptical
  galaxies.</p>

  <p>Following post-doctoral positions at Kitt Peak National Observatory from
  1988 to 1991 and at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of
  Washington from 1991 to 1992, Richard joined the scientific staff of Cerro
  Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, part of the NSF's National Optical
  Astronomy Observatory. By 1994, he had become head of CTIO's IR
  instrumentation program and was leading the development of new instruments for
  the US astronomical community.</p>

  <p>In 1996, Richard married astronomer Elizabeth Lada, and both joined the
  faculty of the University of Florida. They worked closely together and with
  their colleagues to develop the department into a leading center for
  astronomical research. Richard assembled a strong near-IR instrument team
  whose most recently completed instrument was FLAMINGOS, the FLoridA
  Multi-object Imaging Near-IR Grism Observational Spectrometer. FLAMINGOS
  serves as both a wide-field IR imager and multi-object spectrograph.
  Successfully used at the 6.5-m MMT Observatory, 8-m Gemini South telescope,
  and KPNO 2.1-m and Mayall 4-m telescopes, FLAMINGOS allows scientists to
  complete observations in one night that would previously have required 100
  nights. FLAMINGOS is the primary instrument for several major survey programs
  that are studying topics ranging from how individual stars and planets form to
  how the largest structures in the Universe evolve.</p>

  <p>One of Richard's innovations with FLAMINGOS was the use of a separate
  "pre-dewar" that maintains at cryogenic temperatures the multi-slit masks
  required to select the targets for observation, but can be thermally cycled
  more quickly than the entire instrument. This feature allows the changing of
  masks on a nightly basis. New instruments having the innovations pioneered
  with FLAMINGOS are under construction and are to be used at several of the
  world's largest telescopes in the decades ahead.</p>

  <p>Richard was involved in getting both the University of Florida and the U.S.
  astronomical community on the path toward larger telescope facilities. He
  played a crucial role in the University of Florida's joining the team building
  the 10.4-m Grand Telescope of the Canary Islands. As a member of the panel that
  studied optical/near-IR astronomy from the ground for the most recent (2000)
  National Academies decadal review of astronomy, Richard was a passionate
  advocate for open access to the next large (30-m class) telescope to be built.
  The final report included a recommendation for a public role in such a
  telescope. Richard's work as a researcher and educator was recognized in 2000,
  when he was named a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Awards for
  Scientists and Engineers.</p>

  <p>With the birth of his son, Joseph, in 1999, Richard's life reached an
  important milestone. During his battle with cancer, Richard awed everyone with
  his ability to be productive professionally and still be so devoted to his
  family. He and his son shared a love for the outdoors and adventure. Richard
  was an expert SCUBA instructor, skier, hiker, wind surfer, airplane pilot, and
  sailor. Joseph is already a "proto-naturalist." Richard will be best
  remembered as a wonderful father, beloved husband, loving brother, son, uncle,
  friend and inspiration to all whose lives he touched.</p>
