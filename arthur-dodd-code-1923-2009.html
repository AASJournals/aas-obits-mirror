      <h1>Arthur Dodd Code (1923-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Former AAS president Arthur Dodd Code, age 85, passed away at Meriter
  Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin on 11 March 2009, from complications involving
  a long-standing pulmonary condition. Code was born in Brooklyn, New York on 13
  August 1923, as the only child of former Canadian businessman Lorne Arthur
  Code and Jesse (Dodd) Code. An experienced ham radio operator, he entered the
  University of Chicago in 1940, but then enlisted in the U.S. Navy (1943-45)
  and was later stationed as an instructor at the Naval Research Laboratory,
  Washington, D.C. During the war, he gained extensive practical experience with
  the design and construction of technical equipment that served him well in
  years ahead. Concurrently, he took physics courses at George Washington
  University (some under the tutelage of George Gamow). In 1945, he was admitted
  to the graduate school of the University of Chicago, without having received
  his formal bachelor's degree. In 1950, he was awarded his Ph.D. for a
  theoretical study of radiative transfer in O- and B-type stars, directed by
  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.</p>

  <p>Following a one-year appointment at the University of Virginia (1950-51),
  Code was hired onto the faculty of the Department of Astronomy at the
  University of Wisconsin-Madison (1951-56). He then accepted a tenured
  appointment at the California Institute of Technology and the Mount Wilson and
  Palomar Observatories (1956-58). But following the launch of Sputnik, Code
  returned to Wisconsin in 1958 as full professor of astronomy, director of the
  Washburn Observatory, and department chairman so that he could more readily
  pursue his interest in space astronomy. That same year, he was chosen a member
  of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences (created during
  the International Geophysical Year) and shortly became one of five principal
  investigators of the original NASA Space Science Working Group. In a cogent
  1960 essay, Code argued that astrophysical investigations, when conducted from
  beyond the Earth's atmosphere, "cannot fail to have a tremendous impact on the
  future course of stellar astronomy," a prediction strongly borne out in the
  decades that followed.</p>

  <p>In 1959, Code founded the Space Astronomy Laboratory (SAL) within the UW
  Department of Astronomy. Early photometric and spectrographic equipment was
  test-flown aboard NASA's X-15 rocket plane and Aerobee sounding rockets. Along
  with other SAL personnel, including Theodore E. Houck, Robert C. Bless, and
  John F. McNall, Code (as principal investigator) was responsible for the
  design of the Wisconsin Experiment Package (WEP) as one of two suites of
  instruments to be flown aboard the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO),
  which represented a milestone in the advent of space astronomy. With its seven
  reflecting telescopes feeding five filter photometers and two scanning
  spectrometers, WEP permitted the first extended observations in the UV portion
  of the spectrum. After the complete failure of the OAO-1 spacecraft (launched
  in 1966), OAO-2 was successfully launched on 7 December 1968 and gathered data
  on over a thousand celestial objects during the next 50 months, including
  stars, nebulae, galaxies, planets, and comets. These results appeared in a
  series of more than 40 research papers, chiefly in the Ap.J., along with the
  1972 monograph, The Scientific Results from the Orbiting Astronomical
  Observatory (OAO-2), edited by Code.</p>

  <p>Between the OAO launches, other SAL colleagues of Code developed the
  Wisconsin Automatic Photoelectric Telescope (or APT), the first
  computer-controlled (or "robotic") telescope. Driven by a PDP-8 mini-computer,
  it routinely collected atmospheric extinction data. Code was also chosen
  principal investigator for the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter
  Experiment (or WUPPE). This used a UV-sensitive polarimeter designed by
  Kenneth Nordsieck that was flown twice aboard the space shuttles in 1990 and
  1995. Among other findings, WUPPE observations demonstrated that interstellar
  dust does not appreciably change the direction of polarization of starlight,
  thereby supporting its possible composition as graphite.</p>

  <p>Code was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Professional
  Achievement Award of the University of Chicago Alumni Association (1969),
  NASA's Public Service Award (1970), and its highest honor, the Distinguished
  Public Service Medal (1992). He was elected to the National Academy of
  Sciences (1971), the International Academy of Astronautics (1972), chosen a
  Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1974), and elected vice
  president (1976-78) and president (1982-84) of the AAS. He was a member of the
  Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council and served for
  many years on the board of directors (and later was appointed chairman,
  1977-80) of AURA, Inc. Code was closely involved with AURA's bid to manage the
  Space Telescope Science Institute and served as the latter's interim director
  (15 January - 1 September 1981). He also played a significant role in
  establishing the WIYN (Wisconsin, Indiana, Yale, and NOAO) consortium and
  Observatory. Code's numerous achievements reflect his competencies as both a
  theorist and experimentalist/observer, along with noted administrative
  skills.</p>

  <p>During his lengthy career at Wisconsin, Code supervised twenty doctoral
  dissertations (one of which was co-directed with Robert Bless). Following his
  retirement in 1995, he and his wife relocated to Tucson, Arizona, where he was
  appointed adjunct professor at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory
  and concurrently WIYN Observatory Scientist. At the time of his death, he was
  the Joel Stebbins and Hilldale Professor of Astronomy Emeritus at UW-Madison.
  Code belonged to the First Unitarian Church of Madison. He is survived by his
  wife of 65 years, Mary Guild Code, their four children, Alan, Douglas, Edith,
  and David, and six grandchildren.</p>

  <p>Among other sources, this essay draws upon the 1982 oral history interview
  with Code, conducted by David H. DeVorkin (National Air and Space
  Museum/Smithsonian Institution); remarks made by the late Donald E. Osterbrock
  at Code's 80th birthday dinner (2003), Frank K. Edmondson's (1997) history of
  AURA, and previous work published by the author on the WEP. One box of Code's
  papers (1958-1985) is preserved at the Memorial Library Archives, UW-Madison.
  Additional contributions toward this essay have come from Robert W. Smith,
  Robert C. Bless, and the members of Code's family.</p>
