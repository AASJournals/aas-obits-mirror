  </p>

  <p>Accomplished space researcher Charles A. Barth died at his home in Boulder,
  Colo., on 14 October 2014, at the age of 84. Charles directed the <a
  href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/" target="_blank">Laboratory for
  Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)</a> of the University of Colorado Boulder
  (CU-Boulder) from 1965 to 1992. He was among the first researchers to
  recognize the importance of nitric oxide in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and
  its significance to ozone and water vapor. Numerous students he taught at
  CU-Boulder and others from the university community remember him as a devoted
  teacher and mentor.</p>

  <p>Charles spent his childhood in Philadelphia and went on to study chemistry
  at Lehigh University, receiving his B.S. in 1951. After serving in the U.S.
  Air Force, Charles got a Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of California, Los
  Angeles. He was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral
  fellowship to conduct research at the University of Bonn in Germany, from 1958
  to 1959. Returning to the United States, Charles worked as a research
  physicist for the next 6 years in NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at
  the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.</p>

  <h3>30 Years Leading LASP</h3>
  <p>When Charles was named director of LASP in 1965, he and his wife, Louise,
  who met each other in Los Angeles during Charles’s graduate studies, moved
  their family to Boulder. Charles’s steadfast and innovative leadership at LASP
  would span nearly 3 decades. Even after retiring, he remained a committed
  ambassador for LASP and maintained a humble presence in the laboratory
  hallways.</p>

  <p>Charles’s focus on planetary atmospheres included Earth’s middle and upper
  atmosphere. Of 140 papers Charles published, approximately one-quarter
  addressed nitric oxide, including his last paper published in 2010. Many of
  his doctoral students continue similar studies today.</p>

  <h3>Principal Investigator on NASA Missions</h3>
  <p>Charles played a leading role in the development of spaceborne ultraviolet
  spectrometers, small spacecraft platforms, and planetary exploration systems.
  Under his guidance, LASP science instruments journeyed to every planet in the
  solar system. Charles served as the principal investigator for experiments on
  16 NASA missions and flew dozens of new instruments on 59 sounding rocket
  (suborbital) flights. These missions included Mariners 5, 6, 7, and 9;
  Orbiting Geophysical Observatories 2, 4, 5, and 6; Atmosphere Explorer C and
  D; Apollo 17, Pioneer Venus, <a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sme/"
  target="_blank">Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME)</a>, Galileo, Cassini, and <a
  href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/snoe/mission-overview/"
  target="_blank">Student Nitric Oxide Explorer</a> (SNOE).</p>

  <p>With the SME and SNOE missions, Charles demonstrated how to effectively
  develop and manage research missions. The Solar Mesosphere Explorer team
  operated a NASA mission entirely from a university for the first time, and
  LASP’s tradition of conducting missions with a combination of professional
  staff and students still thrives today. Charles built many <a
  href="http://www.thespectroscopynet.eu/?Spectrometers:Monochromator:Fastie-Ebert_configuration"
  target="_blank">Ebert-Fastie grating spectrometers</a>, such as the Mariner 6
  spectrometer he holds in the photo.</p>

  <p>Charles participated extensively in helping guide the space research
  community. He served on NASA’s Space and Earth Science Advisory Committee
  (1982–1985) and the NASA Advisory Council’s Solar System Exploration Committee
  (1980–1987).</p>

  <p>Awards and honors he received include the American Geophysical Union
  Nicolet Lecture (1999), JPL’s Distinguished Visiting Scientist appointment
  (1995), the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal (1983), the NASA
  Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal (1972), and the University of
  Colorado Robert L. Stearns Award (1970).</p>

  <h3>Inspiring the Next Generation</h3>
  <p>In addition to his long and productive research career, Charles left a
  lasting legacy through his teaching and mentoring. He began teaching in 1965
  at CU-Boulder as an associate professor. In 1967, he advanced to full
  professor of astrophysical and planetary sciences. In 2002, he became
  professor emeritus.</p>

  <p>Charles generously shared his knowledge and passion, inspiring both
  colleagues and students while developing the next generation of space science
  researchers to carry forward the work. He served as the primary adviser for
  nearly two dozen doctoral students at CU-Boulder. In addition, he inspired
  countless undergraduates studying science and engineering. Through his
  commitment to hands-on education and training, Charles involved many students
  in his space research and NASA missions. Today, <a
  href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/about/cu-students-at-lasp/"
  target="_blank">students still receive hands-on experience</a> designing and
  operating spacecraft at LASP.</p>

  <p>Charles’s passion for teaching extended beyond the university campus. He
  volunteered with the Boy Scouts of America for many years. He shared his love
  of the majestic Colorado Rocky Mountains through camping and hiking with the
  Scouts and with his family. His children fondly recall family projects—fueled
  by their dad’s love of science and technology—that included building
  televisions, radios, and garage door openers.</p>

  <p>In 2013, CU-Boulder established the Charles A. Barth Scholarship in Space
  Research. The university awarded the first Barth scholarship to CU-Boulder
  student Wren Suess, shortly before Charles’s death.</p>

  <p>Charles’s wife of 60 years, Louise, and four children survive him. We will
  miss seeing Charles in the halls of LASP and discussing the latest research
  discoveries with him. His achievements in space research will be forever
  etched in NASA’s and LASP’s history.</p>
