  <p>Solar Physicist Arthur B. C. Walker, Professor of Physics and Applied
  Physics at Stanford University and a mentor of women and minority students,
  died at his home on 29 April 2001 after a lengthy battle with cancer.</p>

  <p>Art Walker was born in Cleveland on 24 August 1936, the only child of
  Cuthbert and Hilda Walker. In 1941 his family moved to New York City. From an
  early age Art developed an interest in science. Following the footsteps of
  Albert Einstein—the hero of most of us young adults in those days—Art decided
  to pursue science after being admitted to Bronx High School of Science. He
  faced many obvious obstacles including attempts by a teacher to discourage him
  from being a scientist. With his mother's support, and inspired by his other
  role model, Benjamin Banneker—the first African American man of science in the
  United States—Art earned his bachelor degree in physics with honors from Case
  Western Institute of Technology in 1957. He went on to achieve Master's (1958)
  and doctorate (1962) degrees at the University of Illinois. Art was elected to
  membership of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi and Sigma Pi Phi fraternity for black
  professionals.</p>

  <p>Art joined the US Air Force in 1962. While on active duty, he participated
  in the development of instruments for a rocket-launched satellite
  investigation of the Van Allen Belts. After completion of his military service
  in 1965, he joined the Space Physics laboratory of the Aerospace Corporation.
  There he began his long career of investigation of the solar atmosphere using
  rocket-launched instruments, initially at ultraviolet wavelengths and later
  with X-rays. He came to Stanford as a professor in the department of Applied
  Physics in 1974 and by 1991 he held a joint appointment in the Physics and
  Applied Physics departments.</p>

  <p>During his whole career at Stanford, Art was an active member of the Center
  for space Science and Astrophysics and the Astronomy Program. He chaired the
  latter program from 1977 until 1980. Art was in charge of the student
  observatory located in the foothills adjacent to the campus and taught popular
  observational astronomy courses at different academic levels. But his most
  lasting contribution to academic life at Stanford was his mentoring of
  graduate students. A majority of his thirteen graduate students were from
  sectors of our society that are under-represented in science, namely women and
  African-Americans. Among these was Sally Ride, the first female U.S.
  astronaut.</p>

  <p>Art's mentoring and acting as role model extended beyond physics and
  astronomy. He was a leader of the African American community at Stanford and
  the longest serving member of the advisory committee for the Afro-American
  studies program. He served as a successful role model for many of the young
  African-American assistant professors including Condoleeza Rice.</p>

  <p>Art Walker had remarkable ability in administering committees and their
  work. His clear thinking and calm, deliberate approach allowed him to find
  ways of solving problems amid conflicting views. This ability was recognized
  at Stanford soon after his arrival when he was appointed Associate Dean of
  Graduate Studies. He served on many other university and departmental
  committees, including acting as ombudsperson for the Physics Department. This
  gift of his was recognized outside Stanford as well. Throughout his career,
  Art led or served on innumerable NASA, NSF, and NAS committees. The Walker
  committee was instrumental in the success of the GONG project. That same
  committee's recommendations led to the unification of the solar observatories
  at Kitt Peak and Sacramento Peak into a National Solar Observatory.</p>

  <p>President Ronald Reagan selected Art Walker, along with such luminaries as
  Neil Armstrong, Richard Feynman and Sally Ride, to serve on the most important
  committee in the history of the US space program, the commission investigating
  the space shuttle Challenger explosion. NASA recognized these services during
  a celebration of Art's work at Stanford in September 2000. At that time, David
  Bohlin and William Wagner surprised Art with the award of NASA's Distinguished
  Public Service Medal in recognition of his "four decades of distinguished
  scholarship, achievements in experimental space sciences and extensive service
  to NASA and the nation in innumerable advisory and review boards."</p>

  <p>Art Walker thrived in use of novel techniques in astronomical observation.
  Soon after his arrival at Stanford he recognized the astronomical potential of
  the multi-layer thin films developed by Troy Barbee, then at the Material
  Sciences Department of Stanford, for a normal incident X-ray telescope. In
  collaboration with Barbee, and others, and with the assistance of graduate and
  sometimes undergraduate students at Stanford, Walker constructed and launched
  successive rocket payloads to carry out observations of the Sun's corona. The
  result of the first such observation, launched in 1987, adorned the cover of
    <cite>
      Science</cite> Magazine in September 1988. In 1991 the group launched an
      instrument with 14 telescopes, and in 1994 another with 19 telescopes,
      each telescope tuned to different narrow X-ray bands. The same technology
      was later used for the instruments on board the CHANDRA X-ray observatory.
      Just before his untimely death, Art was initiating a program of X-ray
      spectroscopy using new technology for the detection of dark matter. That
      technique was developed by Professor Blas Cabrara of Stanford's Physics
      Department.</p>
  <p>Art always appeared calm and had a historical anecdote for each occasion.
  But he was forceful and did not shrink from facing controversy. Art was a
  strong protector of his territory, particularly when it came to affairs
  involving his teaching and his graduate students. He did not shrink from
  responsibilities and taking new tasks. With an optimistic confidence, Art
  could always take on one more task, from as small as writing a letter to as
  time consuming as serving on an important committee. One of my most endearing
  images of Art is seeing him walking to his car, often late past dinnertime,
  with a briefcase and a mid-size suitcase stuffed with work which he expected
  to complete that night. He was a true gentleman who cared for the well being
  of others even when this caring and its results did not enhance his
  professional standing. Art was a loving husband to his wife, Victoria and
  their surviving three children and four grandchildren. He enjoyed growing
  camellias and roses.</p>
