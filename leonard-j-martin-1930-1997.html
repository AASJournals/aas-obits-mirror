      <h1>Leonard J. Martin (1930-1997)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Leonard J. Martin, long-time staff member of the Lowell Observatory and
  noted Mars observer, died suddenly on 7 April 1997 at his home in Bend,
  Oregon. He is survived by his wife Claudia; sons Chris and Nick, and daughter
  Jennifer.</p>

  <p>Leonard was born on 10 March 1930 in Seattle Washington. He attended
  Washington State University in Pullman for two years and then transferred to
  the University of Washington, where he earned a degree in geography with a
  specialization in cartography. Following a stint in the U.S. Army, Leonard
  joined the staff of the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC) in
  St. Louis. In 1963, he came to Lowell Observatory as a member of the ACIC team
  charged with preparing maps of the Moon in preparation for the Apollo
  Missions. When that job was completed in 1967, Leonard transferred to the
  Lowell staff and began work on a Mars cloud survey under the direction of
  William Baum. In the course of this investigation, he developed a passion for
  the Red Planet that continued undiminished through the remainder of his
  scientific career.</p>

  <p>In 1969, Leonard continued his study of Mars as an International Planetary
  Patrol observer and data analyst. The Patrol, which was organized and operated
  by Lowell Observatory, under a NASA grant, consisted of a global network of
  similarly-equipped telescopes photographing Mars, Jupiter, and sometimes Venus
  and Saturn on a coordinated hourly schedule. Patrol photographs provided the
  basis for a number of investigations of Martian phenomena, which Martin
  undertook independently or in collaboration with Baum and others. Martian
  clouds, dust storms, and the advance and recession of the polar caps were of
  particular interest to Leonard, and, over the years, he developed an
  encyclopedic knowledge of Mars' historical photographic record. His papers on
  the dust storms of 1971 (which interfered with the Mariner 9 mission) and 1973
  were particularly important.</p>

  <p>Beginning about 1976, Martin became involved with Baum, Karl Lumme, and
  others in investigations of Mars based on data from the Viking orbiter.
  Subsequently, his collaborations expanded to include work with Phil James,
  Rich Zurek, Steve Lee, and others. He was a member of a team headed by James
  which used the Hubble Space Telescope in a number of Martian imaging
  investigations. Through all of this time, Leonard maintained a firm belief in
  the importance of continued synoptic imaging of Mars from the ground to
  provide the long-term context essential to full interpretation of the higher
  resolution space-based imaging. For many years, he championed the continuation
  of a barebones planetary patrol, and, in spite of an increasingly difficult
  battle with heart disease, made many observations himself using telescopes at
  Lowell and on Mauna Kea.</p>

  <p>Leonard Martin was a meticulous and cautious student of Mars. He was slow
  to jump to conclusions and careful to place current observations within the
  context of the historical record. He was a pleasant and considerate colleague
  who put forward his views in a quiet, if persistent, manner. Leonard was in a
  sense a disciple of E.C. Slipher and, to a degree, Percival Lowell. He
  believed Mars could best be understood through long and careful observation,
  looking for patterns, cycles, and other manifestations which could be securely
  interpreted in terms of physical phenomena. As such, he provided a link to the
  heritage of this institution. He will be missed.</p>
