  <p>Adrian D. Herzog died of an apparent heart attack on the evening of 28
  February 2001. He is survived by his mother, Gertrud Herzog, and his wife,
  Dora. Adrian's father, Emil R. Herzog, a well-known astronomer, passed away in
  1998 (<em>BAAS</em>, 30, 4:457). At the time of his death, Adrian was the
  chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at California State
  University, Northridge (CSUN).</p>

  <p>Adrian received his BA in 1971 at the University of California, Los Angeles
  and in 1972 an MS in Astronomy at San Diego State University, where he was the
  first MS student of Ron Angione. He carried out his PhD research at New Mexico
  State University where he received his PhD in 1977 under Walt Sanders. Adrian
  worked on a wide variety of projects while completing his PhD, publishing
  papers on subjects ranging from open cluster photometry (his first
  publication, in 1975), to observations of Mercury and Europa, to globular
  cluster measurements. Adrian's PhD thesis was an analysis of numerical
  integration techniques for open cluster modeling and their implications for
  the star loss rate from such clusters. His friend Rita Beebe recalls that
  Adrian's nickname during his graduate student days was "Assistant Department
  Head." While he was teased about this, she says, "It was sure nice to have a
  student who was fully involved in the department." While at NMSU, Adrian also
  worked at the VLA from 1976 to 1978, where he was one of the original members
  of the system integration group. After his arrival at CSUN, Adrian would often
  regale us with tales of "stupid observer tricks" from his time as a telescope
  operator.</p>

  <p>In 1978 Adrian moved to the University of Wyoming where his interests
  shifted to infrared observations. He coauthored an article with Gary
  Grasdalen, John Hackwell, and Robert Gehrz on the then-new techniques of
  infrared imaging for
    <cite>
      Sky and Telescope</cite> in 1980. Adrian also published an article on
      infrared photometry of the peculiar object MWC 349 in which he identified
      the optical counterpart of the infrared source, now believed to be a main
      sequence star with a disk. Adrian took charge of the new Wyoming
      planetarium. His knowledge of how to run a planetarium would be of great
      value at Northridge.</p>
  <p>In 1981, Adrian took a tenure track position at CSUN as an assistant
  professor. He soon began to involve himself in the research efforts at the San
  Fernando Observatory (SFO) on top of a heavy teaching schedule. He helped at
  the SFO by carrying out observations and writing thousands of lines of code
  for data reduction software to reduce photometric and magnetic field
  measurements. In the early 1990s, the need for a planetarium became clear.
  Adrian worked with Donald Bianchi, the dean of the College of Science and
  Mathematics, to push for funding for a planetarium as part of a new science
  addition. The new planetarium was dedicated in 1991, just a few years before
  the "Northridge" earthquake. Naturally, Adrian was its first director.</p>

  <p>In 1996, Adrian was elected chairman of the Department, a position he
  greatly enjoyed and one that won him widespread respect at CSUN. According to
  the office staff, who observed him on a daily basis, he was a great manager
  and a team player. Adrian always kept his door open for students. No matter
  how busy he was he would accept the students with a smile, never talking down
  to anybody. He was a people person, approachable but firm with his decisions.
  He would always willingly contribute to affairs of the department, bringing
  students, staff and faculty together on different occasions such as the annual
  Christmas party and the annual department picnic.</p>

  <p>Adrian's sense of humor helped him in his teaching and was immensely
  helpful when he was chairman. He will be greatly missed by his colleagues at
  CSUN.</p>

  <p>Helpful comments were received from Rita Beebe and the secretaries in the
  CSUN Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
