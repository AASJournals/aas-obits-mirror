      <h1>Rodger Doxsey (1947-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Rodger Doxsey, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute,
  passed away on October 13, 2009, after a prolonged illness. For the past 20
  years, Rodger has been known to be truly the go-to guy for making the Hubble
  Space Telescope perform as it has. I have always argued that no person is
  truly irreplaceable. I still believe that to be true. However, my colleague
  and friend Rodger Doxsey came probably as close as anyone ever could to being
  irreplaceable. I know of no one who had a deeper and more thorough
  understanding of the workings of HST than Rodger had. In fact, there used to
  be a joke around the Institute, that when Rodger goes on vacation, the
  telescope experiences some malfunction.</p>

  <p>Usually when we retire a computer, we make sure that all the information on
  it is stored elsewhere. Unfortunately we cannot do the same with the human
  brain. Rodger was always driven by one passion - the desire to make the Hubble
  Space Telescope the most productive scientific instrument ever. He has been
  involved with, and often led, every effort to prolong the life of the
  telescope, and to make it operate more efficiently.</p>

  <p>Here is a description by another Hubble pioneer, astronomer John Bahcall,
  of the birth of the "Hubble Space Telescope Snapshot Program," a wonderful
  example of one of Rodger's many brainchildren:</p>

  <p>"The Snapshot program originated in a lunchtime conversation between Rodger
  Doxsey and myself in the STScI cafeteria sometime in the spring of 1989. We
  were both late to lunch and probably were the only people in the cafeteria.
  The principal topic of conversation was the expected low observing efficiency
  of the HST. Rodger described the extraordinary difficulty in making a schedule
  that would use a reasonable percentage of the available time for science
  observations. Slewing was slow and changing instruments or modes of observing
  was time-consuming. Also, the scheduling software that existed in 1989 was not
  very powerful. I asked Rodger, without thinking very carefully about what I
  was saying, if it would be possible for the software he was developing to
  insert new objects in the holes in the schedule. I wondered aloud if one could
  improve the efficiency by choosing new objects, close to the directions of the
  scheduled targets, from a previously prepared list of interesting objects
  scattered over the sky. I remember that Rodger suddenly became very quiet,
  thought about the question, and finally replied something like: 'In principle,
  it is possible.' The Snapshot program was born at that lunch."</p>

  <p>Rodger Doxsey was born in Schenectady, New York, on March 11, 1947. He is
  survived by his companion, Vicky Balzano, who also works at STScI; his father,
  John, of Cleveland, Ohio; and his four siblings, Martha Doxsey of Edmonton,
  Alberta; Douglas Doxsey of Ironwood, Michigan; Virginia Doxsey of Boston; and
  Mary Lou Shane of Duxbury, Vermont. As a boy, his sisters described, he used
  to be absorbed in crossword puzzles and jigsaw puzzles. At MIT, where he
  studied physics and earned his Ph.D., he became fascinated with rowing, and he
  kept returning every year to race with his old crewmates in the Head of the
  Charles Regatta. He was also very fond of the work of the American artist
  Alexander Calder, and a lithograph of one of his drawings hung on the wall of
  his office.</p>

  <p>Very few people know of a ritual Rodger and I have developed over the
  years. During the first servicing mission and subsequent observatory
  verification, Rodger and I used to spend nights at the Institute, following
  all the tests for the instruments. After the performance test of each
  instrument, we shook hands ceremoniously. This became somewhat of a
  superstition, and consequently, in all the following servicing missions we
  continued with the same ritual. During SM4, Rodger was already too weak to
  attend all the activities continuously. We did meet, however, after the
  completion of SM4, and performed the ritualistic handshake to celebrate all
  the instruments.</p>

  <p>Goodbye friend. Hubble's Guardian. To me, you will always be
  irreplaceable.</p>
