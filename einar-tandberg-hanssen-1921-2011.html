<div>
  <p>Dr. Einar Andreas Tandberg-Hanssen was born on 6 August 1921, in Bergen,
  Norway, and died on July 22, 2011, in Huntsville, AL, USA, due to
  complications from ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, often referred to as
  Lou Gehrig’s disease).</p>

  <p>His parents were administrator Birger Tandberg-Hanssen (1883-1951) and
  secretary Antonie “Mona” Meier (1895-1967).</p>

  <p>He married Erna Rønning (27 October 1921 - 22 November 1994), a nurse, on
  22 June 1951. She was the daughter of Captain Einar Rønning (1890-1969) and
  Borghild Lyshaug (1897-1980).</p>

  <p>Einar and Erna had two daughters, Else Biesman (and husband Allen of Rapid
  City, SD, USA) and Karin Brock (and husband Mike of Gulf Shores, AL, USA). At
  the time of his death Einar had eight grandchildren and eight
  great-grandchildren.</p>

  <p>Dr. Tandberg-Hanssen was an internationally-known member of the solar
  physics community, with over a hundred published scientific papers and several
  books, including <i>Solar Activity</i> (1967), <i>Solar Prominences</i>
  (1974), <i>The Physics of Solar Flares</i> (1988) and <i>The Nature of Solar
  Prominences</i> (1995).</p>

  <p>Einar grew up in Langesund and Skien, Norway, where he took the qualifying
  exams at Skien High School in 1941. After the war he studied natural sciences
  at the University of Oslo and received his undergraduate degree in astronomy
  in 1950.</p>

  <p>He worked as a research assistant in the Institute of Theoretical
  Astrophysics at the University of Oslo for three intervals in the 1950s,
  interspersed by fellowships at the Institut d'Astrophysique in Paris, Caltech
  in Pasadena, CA, the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, CO, and the
  Cavendish Laboratory in the UK (at the invitation of British radio-astronomer
  Sir Martin Ryle). He earned a doctorate in astrophysics at the University in
  Oslo in 1960 with a dissertation titled “An Investigation of the Temperature
  Conditions in Prominences with a Special Study of the Excitation of
  Helium.”</p>

  <p>From 1959-61, Tandberg-Hanssen was a professor at the University in Oslo.
  He then traveled back to the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado,
  where he was employed until 1974. He was then employed at the Space Science
  Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville,
  Alabama. There, he was a Senior Research Scientist and later Deputy Director
  of the Laboratory. He served as Lab Director from 1987 until his retirement
  from NASA in 1993. He promptly took a part-time post within the Center for
  Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research at The University of Alabama in
  Huntsville, where he worked until his death.</p>

  <p>During his tenure at NASA, he, along with Dr. Mona Hagyard and Dr. S. T.
  Wu, built up a substantial, internationally-based group of solar physicists at
  MSFC and UA Huntsville. He was a lead investigator on two instruments aboard
  NASA spacecraft: the S-056 X-Ray Event Analyzer on the <i>Skylab</i> Apollo
  Telescope Mount (which provided pioneering, high-time-cadence temperature and
  density information on solar X-ray-emitting regions) and the Ultraviolet
  Spectrometer and Polarimeter on the <i>Solar Maximum Mission</i> (which
  carried out sweeping new studies of EUV emission from solar active regions and
  flares). Dr. Tandberg-Hanssen’s books about various aspects of solar activity,
  viz. <em>Solar Activity</em> (Blaisdell, 1967), <i>Solar Prominences</i>
  (Reidel, 1974), <i>The Physics of Solar Flares</i> (with A. G. Emslie)
  (Cambridge, 1988), and <i>The Nature of Solar Prominences</i> (Reidel, 1995),
  have become international standard works within the discipline of solar
  physics.</p>

  <p>In 1982, Dr. Tandberg-Hanssen was elected to membership in the Norwegian
  Academy of Science and Letters. From 1979-82 and 1982-85, respectively, he
  served as vice-president and president of Commission 10 of the International
  Astronomical Union (IAU). He served as president of the Federation of
  Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services from 1990-1994. He has
  received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He was also a long time editor of
  the journal <i>Solar Physics</i>.</p>

  <p>Dr. Tandberg-Hanssen’s <i>Solar Physics</i> Memoir paper, entitled <i>Solar
  Prominences - An Intriguing Phenomenon</i> <a
  href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/1166j74k577kv332/">http://www.springerlink.com/content/1166j74k577kv332/</a>
  was published shortly before his death. The article starts with an
  autobiographical account, where the author relates how his several study-trips
  abroad gradually led him to the study of solar physics in general, and
  prominences particularly.</p>

  <p>Einar's residence as a research fellow at the Institut d'Astrophysique in
  Paris in the 1950s laid the foundation for a lifelong interest in France and
  French culture. His great interest in and knowledge of French mediaeval
  churches, as well as the Norwegian stave churches, is reflected in two books,
  <em>Letters to My Daughters</em> (Ivy House Pub. Group, 2004), and <em>The Joy
  of Travel: More Letters to My Daughters</em> (Pentland Press, 2007), which
  serve as a review, tourist guide and history book, shaped in the form of
  letters home to his two daughters, from his many travels in Norway and
  France.</p>

  <p>Einar was a true gentleman and a true scholar. As evidenced by his papers,
  his books, and his dealings with others, he was always seeking not only to
  expand his own knowledge and understanding, but also to find new ways of
  communicating his remarkable insight to others. He is survived by his
  daughters, Else and Karin, and their families.</p>
