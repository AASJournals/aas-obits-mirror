  <p>James R. Houck, the leading figure in developing infrared spectroscopy for
  astrophysics, died in Ithaca, NY, on September 18, 2015, at age 74 from
  complications of Alzheimer's Disease. He was born on October 5, 1940, in
  Mobile, Alabama, but lived much of his early life in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
  where he received his undergraduate degree from Carnegie Institute of
  Technology. Jim spent his scientific career at Cornell University. He came to
  Cornell as a physics graduate student in 1962 and remained until his
  retirement as the Kenneth A. Wallace Professor of Astronomy in 2012. His only
  year away from Ithaca was as a Guggenheim Fellow at Caltech, and he declined
  job offers from other universities because of his opinion that Ithaca provided
  the best environment for raising his family. His passion for learning, doing,
  and teaching science by building instruments and understanding physics led to
  great benefits for his students and astronomy colleagues.</p>

  <p>After receiving his PhD in condensed matter physics, he changed fields to
  work in astronomy at Cornell. He first collaborated with colleague Martin
  Harwit to develop a rocket program at Cornell for infrared observations and
  made numerous treks to the White Sands Missile Range flying payloads on
  Aerobee sounding rockets. Jim emphasized building spectrographs and making
  pioneering observations with ground based, airborne, and rocket-borne infrared
  instrumentation. Jim flew on every airplane NASA provided for astronomy. Those
  were pioneering times. One of his survival stories was of the Learjet in which
  both engines flamed out over the Pacific when the pilot did a celebratory
  barrel role after successful completion of their observations. His
  observations with rockets and airplanes were primarily of a variety of
  Galactic objects, including planetary nebulae, HII regions, and stars. But the
  most notable was an observation on the Convair 990 that produced a prescient
  discovery paper in 1973 led by Jim which discovered bound water on Mars from
  infrared absorption at 2.85 microns. The analysis that "this bound water
  comprises about one percent by weight of the surface material" was confirmed
  forty years later when the Mars Rover Curiosity determined water content by
  vaporizing Martian soil.</p>

  <p>Jim was a crucial participant in NASA's first major infrared space mission,
  the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), especially because of his detector
  expertise which solved a major focal plane problem for the mission. His
  archive contains a napkin from a British pub on which he sketched a wiring
  diagram to show his colleagues how to save the 25 micron detector array. Once
  the results began from IRAS, Jim's scientific interests moved to extragalactic
  astronomy. He was a major participant in two of the most significant
  discoveries from IRAS, announced in 1984: an extended population of optically
  faint, infrared bright galaxies, and the presence of galaxies with exceptional
  infrared luminosities (now known as the Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,
  ULIRGs).</p>

  <p>After the great success of IRAS, NASA begin planning a major infrared
  mission, first labeled "Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility" but soon becoming
  the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), and now operating as the
  Spitzer Space Telescope. Although hundreds contributed, Jim was among the few
  individuals who contributed most to the success of Spitzer. His colleagues
  acknowledged this by awarding him both the NASA Exceptional Scientific
  Achievement Medal in 2005 and the American Astronomical Society's 2008 Joseph
  Weber Award for Astronomical Instrumentation, with the citation stating, "It
  is no exaggeration to say that without Dr. Houck's contributions, modern IR
  astronomy would never have reached its current level of maturity."</p>

  <p>Jim was the Principal Investigator for the infrared spectrograph on Spitzer
  (IRS), initially chosen for the original SIRTF mission. Jim became the vital
  infrared representative on the review panel setting astronomy's priorities for
  the 1990s (the "Bahcall Report"), and his persuasive advocacy convinced the
  panel that SIRTF should be the decade's highest priority. Subsequently, Jim
  chaired the NASA HQ Astrophysics Advisory Committee and played a crucial role
  in organizing and participating in legislative advocacy for the SIRTF "new
  start" that was needed. Jim's extraordinary technical expertise was vital to
  the essential redesign of SIRTF required to meet NASA targets for the mission
  cost.</p>

  <p>Following the success of IRAS, SIRTF was intended primarily as a
  photometric mission. Jim was the advocate for spectroscopy which subsequently
  turned out to be the instrument in greatest demand for the cryogenic Spitzer
  mission.</p>

  <p>Jim's first scientific paper with the IRS in 2005 announced the presence of
  a large population of quasars in the early universe so heavily obscured by
  dust that they had been invisible to optical telescopes. The legacy of the
  Spitzer IRS is now permanently in place as the "Cornell Atlas of Spitzer IRS
  Sources" (CASSIS at cassis.sirtf.com), providing an easily accessible archive
  of mid-infrared spectra (5-37 micron) for everything from outer planet
  satellites to quasars at the edge of the observable universe. CASSIS will be
  the fundamental reference archive of mid-infrared spectra for the upcoming
  James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

  <p>During all these years of major research projects, Jim maintained a
  consistent dedication to high quality undergraduate teaching, simultaneously
  with advising numerous PhD students. His most notable legacy for
  undergraduates at Cornell was his development by 1974 of a research quality
  telescope close to campus to teach instrumentation and observational
  techniques. The 25 inch telescope of the Hartung-Boothroyd Observatory not
  only trained Cornell students for decades, but was also a testbed for
  spectrographs. What students felt about Jim was summarized by a former
  undergraduate who told us, "It is no stretch whatsoever to say that I would
  not be anything close to what I am today had I not run into Jim in my first
  Cornell Astro course." To improve Cornell's access to ground based observing,
  Jim also initiated a partnership with Caltech in the Hale 5 m telescope and
  led development of Cornell instruments for that facility.</p>

  <p>The sad aspect of Jim's accomplishments was the distraction from his
  celebration of the IRS success by the long term care he gave to his beloved
  wife Elaine. They married in 1965, and Elaine became partially disabled a few
  years before the Spitzer launch. Jim assembled an extraordinary team to assure
  the success of the IRS, frequently making grueling trips from Ithaca to
  Pasadena and hurrying home to care for Elaine, who died in 2011. This
  combination of dedicated personal affection and incredible talent as an
  astrophysicist summarizes the uniqueness of James R. Houck. He is survived by
  his sons, Chris and Robert, and by four grandchildren.</p>
