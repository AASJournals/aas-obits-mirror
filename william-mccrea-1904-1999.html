  <p>Sir William Hunter ('Bill') McCrea, doyen of British astronomy, held in
  respect and affection by all generations, died peacefully on April 25, at the
  age of 94. McCrea was born in Dublin, the eldest child of a schoolmaster. His
  parents were strict members of the Plymouth Brethren, but by the age of
  eighteen he had become a confirmed Anglican, a faith he retained all his
  life.</p>

  <p>By 1907 the family had moved to Chesterfield, Derbyshire, where Bill
  attended first the Central (elementary) School and then the Grammar School,
  from which he won an entrance scholarship in Mathematics to Trinity College,
  Cambridge. He read for the Mathematics Tripos, becoming a Wrangler in 1926. He
  specialised in those branches of mathematical physics which were stimulating
  exciting research at Cambridge, and after graduating he began research as one
  of the many pupils of R.H. Fowler (to whom he paid warm tribute on his 1989
  Centenary). Although initially he worked on basic problems in quantum physics
  and relativity, and also on related problems in pure mathematics, his interest
  gradually focused on the application of theoretical physics to the
  astronomical universe, ranging from the constitution of stellar atmospheres,
  through the formation of planets and stars, to cosmology, the study of the
  universe as a whole.</p>

  <p>Recognition came early with a Cambridge University Rayleigh Prize, a
  Trinity College Rouse Ball Senior Studentship, a Sheepshanks Exhibition and an
  Isaac Newton Studentship. After spending the year 1928-29 as visitor in
  Goettingen, McCrea began his rapid rise up the regular academic ladder as
  Lecturer in the Edinburgh Department of Mathematics, headed by Edmund
  Whittaker, followed by four years as Reader at Imperial College, London. In
  1936 he moved to Queen's University, Belfast as Professor of Mathematics. In
  1943 he was given leave from Belfast while doing Operational Research in the
  Admiralty in the team led by Patrick M.S. Blackett. After VE-day in 1945, with
  the rank of Temporary Captain in the RNVR he had the task of interviewing
  German naval officers in Schleswig-Holstein. He in fact did not return to
  Belfast, as in 1944 he had been appointed Professor at Royal Holloway College,
  London, taking up the appointment at the end of the War. McCrea remained at
  Holloway till 1966, when he took up his last appointment as SRC-supported
  Research Professor of Theoretical Astronomy at the recently established
  University of Sussex. Shortly after the War, he had urged the setting-up of a
  national institute of theoretical astronomy. The subsequent rather tortuous
  negotiations led to the establishment of the Institute of Theoretical
  Astronomy in Cambridge (now united with the Cambridge Observatories to form
  the Institute of Astronomy), and a smaller Astronomy Center in Sussex, with
  McCrea as the first Research Professor and the late Roger Tayler as the first
  UGC-supported professor. With the enthusiastic support of the Astronomer
  Royal, Sir Richard Woolley, and the other senior staff at the Royal Greenwich
  Observatory, McCrea and Tayler jointly put Sussex on to the world Astronomy
  map. McCrea was a versatile astrophysicist. Many of his papers have had a
  permanent effect on the way subsequent workers have formulated the various
  problems under discussion. He was an early advocate of the now-accepted view
  that stars should have a high hydrogen content. He pioneered study of the
  formation in dusty interstellar clouds of the hydrogen molecule, a crucial
  cooling agent, and of other molecules, and gave an elegant treatment of the
  way such clouds, when externally compressed, can reach densities high enough
  for gravitational collapse to ensue, leading possibly to break-up into
  stars.</p>

  <p>His other contributions to cosmical gas dynamics included a proposal for
  turbulent support for the solar chromosphere, and detailed studies of the
  gravitational accretion of interstellar gas by already formed stars; though
  like many of his generation, he was slow to appreciate the importance of
  electromagnetic processes in astronomy. Concerning relativity theory, he
  vigorously rebutted misunderstandings of the so-called 'twin paradox' that
  persisted in reappearing in the literature. He also pointed out that the
  cosmical constant that appears in Einstein's modified version of general
  relativity can be interpreted as the energy density of the vacuum. Together
  with Edward A. Milne he showed that the various cosmological models emerging
  from Einstein's theory have simply understood Newtonian analogues. When
  evolutionary cosmology appeared to face observational difficulties, he showed
  a commendable flexibility of mind (a quality not always visible in members of
  the scientific Establishment) in his taking seriously the alternative
  steady-state theory, proposed by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle,
  and in fact showed how the model could be treated within the mathematical
  framework of general relativity; but he later accepted that, at least in its
  original form, the theory could no longer hold up against the accumulating
  evidence from optical and radio observations. In his later years, he expressed
  scepticism about the feasibility of the whole cosmological enterprise.</p>

  <p>In addition to his many papers and reviews, McCrea wrote the texts
  <em>Relativity Physics</em>, <em>Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions</em>,
  the less technical <em>Physics of the Sun and Stars</em>, and together with
  Tayler, the second volume of the <em>History of the Royal Astronomical
  Society</em>. Like Tayler, his services to astronomy went far beyond his
  technical contributions. He was successively Council member, Secretary,
  President, Foreign Correspondent and Treasurer of the RAS, and for some years
  he was editor of <em>Observatory</em> and of the <em>RAS Monthly Notices</em>.
  He served on the Councils of the Royal Society, of the London Mathematical
  Society, and of the Royal Institute of Philosophy.</p>

  <p>He also gave public service as a school governor. McCrea received many
  invitations to visit, from all over the world. He was a bye-Fellow at Caius
  College, Cambridge, and visiting professor or lecturer at Berkeley, the Case
  Institute at Cleveland, UBC at Vancouver, Louvain, Cairo, Istanbul, Otago,
  among others. Further recognition came with honorary degrees from the National
  University of Ireland, Queen's University at Belfast, the National University
  at Cordoba, Argentina, and the Universities of Dublin and Sussex; and he was
  Member of the Akademia Leopoldina, and Foreign Member of the Turin Academy of
  Sciences. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1952. He was a kindly,
  slightly shy man, but with hidden reserves of strength, remaining
  intellectually active well into his nineties. His somewhat formal manner was
  rather misleading; he was in fact a gregarious figure, especially committed to
  the RAS and the RS Dining Clubs.</p>

  <p>He will be mourned world-wide by colleagues and friends, and not least by
  former undergraduate and graduate students, who recall with gratitude his help
  and warm encouragement.</p>
