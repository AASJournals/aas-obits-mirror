      <h1>Richard Nelson Thomas (1921-1996)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Richard Thomas died in his sleep at his home in Boulder, Colorado the night
  of Monday, April 8-9. Dick had suffered a stroke during surgery in the spring
  of 1992, and struggled courageously with the subsequent partial paralysis for
  the next four years, always keeping his interest in astronomy, astronomers and
  his family foremost among his thoughts. He is survived by his wife, Nora,
  their step-daughter, Anush, and his daughter, Bess Alta.</p>

  <p>Dick was born in Omaha, Nebraska on 3 March 1921 to Joseph Francis Thomas,
  lawyer and businessman, and to Mabel (née Nelson) Thomas. He attended high
  school in Omaha, where he was a top debater and wrestler, and continued to
  excel in both as he entered Harvard in 1938. Dick planned to become a chemical
  engineer, but after taking courses from Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin and Donald
  Menzel he switched to astronomy. He was excited by the application of the Saha
  equation to spectral classification and the emergence of a formalism for
  treating processes in planetary nebulae far from a state of thermodynamic
  equilibrium. He received his Bachelors degree in physics from Harvard in 1942
  and his PhD in astrophysics in 1948 working with Menzel, with a thesis on
  "Superthermal Phenomena in Stellar Atmospheres."</p>

  <p>During World War II Dick served at the Army Ballistics Laboratory in
  Aberdeen, Maryland. His military duty contributed to his lifelong interest in
  stellar winds, as demonstrated by photographs of supersonic and hypersonic
  shock patterns taken at Aberdeen that appear in his last book. In 1949, Dick
  moved to the University of Utah, where astrophysicist Eugene Parker was one of
  his colleagues and Grant Athay one of his first graduate students. During this
  period he began a highly productive collaboration with Athay and Jean Claude
  Pecker, who in 1952 participated in a now famous eclipse expedition to
  Khartoum. This expedition provided the necessary observations to test and
  confirm Dick's ideas on strong departures from thermodynamic equilibrium in
  the solar chromosphere. As a result of this work, he and Athay edited <em>The
  Physics of the Solar Chromosphere</em> (1961), one of the best known books on
  the subject. It had a profound influence on the development of non-LTE theory
  for the analysis of stellar spectra.</p>

  <p>Following his years in Utah, working again at Harvard and then at the High
  Altitude Observatory and the Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado, Dick
  and others conceived the plan for what was to become The Joint Institute for
  Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA). Discussions with Bureau scientist Louis
  Branscomb, former Bureau Head Ed Condon and members of the Boulder scientific
  community led to the creation of JILA in 1962 as a joint Bureau/University of
  Colorado institute for the pursuit of research and teaching that has since
  gained a worldwide reputation.</p>

  <p>Dick began the JILA Visiting Fellows Program which brought many
  distinguished astrophysicists to Boulder over the past 30 years. Directly or
  indirectly, he was also responsible for building up the JlLA staff. For his
  services to astronomy and to the Bureau in helping to establish JlLA, Dick
  received the Gold Medal for Exceptional Service from the United States
  Department of Commerce in 1963.</p>

  <p>Dick served as President of the IAU Stellar Atmospheres Commission in the
  early 1970s and was a prime mover behind and the editor for a series of
  international symposia on Cosmical Gas Dynamics. He was Foreign Correspondent
  of
    <cite>
      Annales d'Astrophysique</cite>, an editor for <em>The Physics of
      Fluids</em>, a member of the RAS and a Corresponding Member of the Société
      Royale des Sciences de Liège. Other academic appointments included an
      adjunct professorship at the University of Colorado and visiting professor
      at the University of Paris both beginning in 1961, and, later, visiting
      professor at the College de France.</p>
  <p>After a decade with JlLA, in 1973 Dick joined the staff of the Institut
  d'Astrophysique in Paris, at the behest of Jean-Claude Pecker. Since the 1950s
  they both insisted on the application of non-LTE to solve a number of hitherto
  puzzling problems in interpreting solar spectra, and contributed to making
  non-LTE theory the standard tool for analyzing most stellar spectra,
  especially those spectra formed in the low-density outer regions of the
  chromosphere and the corona.</p>

  <p>In Paris Dick commenced the final major project of his life, a monograph
  series on nonthermal phenomena in stellar atmospheres, backed by the French
  CNRS and by NASA. Leo Goldberg and Pecker were the senior advisers, and I
  became the NASA coordinator for the project. This project produced eight
  volumes covering the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, and were made available to
  astronomers the world over, receiving excellent reviews. Dick contributed
  <em>Stellar Atmospheric Structural Patterns</em>, a book that was vintage Dick
  Thomas: hard to read, full of fresh suggestions, and challenging to much
  conventional thinking on stellar atmospheres. Dick's last major scientific
  interest was the origin of stellar winds. He was convinced that there was a
  common primary driver, or source, of stellar winds for all stars, although he
  acknowledged some important differences between the 'early' and 'late' type
  stars, differences that he nonetheless regarded as secondary rather than
  fundamental in producing their corresponding winds. His approach was to look
  for statistical fluctuations and new sources mass-loss. So far this idea has
  not met with empirical validation or widespread acceptance, especially since
  some of the problems Dick was addressing seem to have found at least partial
  solution through more conventional approaches. Nevertheless, he continued to
  play the role of constructive gadfly to those who accepted conventional wisdom
  all too easily. And there were always a few outstanding astrophysicists who,
  however bizarre some of his ideas seemed at first, felt compelled to ask
  themselves "Dick was often right before. Why would he propose that?"</p>

  <p>In some ways Dick was superseded by the modern era in astronomy. He never
  learned to appreciate the full power of the computer to advance the field, and
  often failed to work through the detailed consequences of his own ideas.
  However, in an era when cleverness and technique had arguably come to dominate
  much scientific endeavor, Dick continued to work in the honorable tradition of
  testing fundamental ideas.</p>

  <p>Dick was always stimulating, but not always easy to work with. In his own
  way he was quite thoughtful, but often after the fact. Anyone working with
  Dick had to be prepared to occasionally say No! to him quite firmly, and to
  make it stick. He believed that he was a good manager, yet often had
  difficulty implementing his projects without others to run interference, not
  unlike a fine running back who still needs a few good blockers along the way.
  Yet he was often extremely generous in praising the contribution of others,
  especially those who had helped him in his work.</p>

  <p>Aside from his speculative work on stellar winds, Dick's major role in
  developing the theory for treating optically thick spectral lines in a stellar
  atmosphere puts him in the front rank of astronomers. Interpretation of
  observations from all space observatories operating in the near and far
  ultraviolet, and from a host of ground-based observatories, has been greatly
  advanced by this fundamental work. And no one was more energetic in
  disseminating these results globally.</p>

  <p>To anyone who showed a strong interest in, or a talent for, astronomy,
  Dick's office and home were always open. In many cases, he helped struggling
  young researchers directly, finding them positions and occasionally direct
  grants. If Dick could be brusque, it was invariably in a sincere effort to
  advance astronomy and astronomers. In moments of relaxation he could be the
  most charming of hosts and the most helpful of friends. Personally, he was
  wonderfully stimulating, and will be remembered for his talent for incisive
  innovation, sincerity, professional courage, and absolute dedication to
  astronomy. In life we often reward reasonable accommodation, less often
  obstreperous individualism, even when it is highly productive.</p>
