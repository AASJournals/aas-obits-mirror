      <h1>James C. Kemp (1927-1988)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>James C. Kemp was born in Detroit, Michigan on 9 February 1927, and died in
  Eugene, Oregon, on 29 March 1988. He went to high school in Mexico City and
  did undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan and University of
  California at Berkeley. Kemp was an active observational astronomer, having
  migrated from earlier interests in Slavic languages, in which he majored,
  electrical engineering, and physics. He obtained a PhD in electrical
  engineering at Berkeley in 1960 and did post-doctoral work there with Erwin
  Hahn on spin resonance. He went to the University of Oregon in 1961 and
  conducted research in magneto-optics, developing, in the process, a
  piezo-optical birefringence modulator to measure circular polarization. The
  modulator is described by Tinbergen (1996).</p>

  <p>Kemp explored new areas as he measured magnetic fields in the sunspots with
  polarized infrared light, and developed polarimeters and photometers to study
  the behavior of such astronomical sources as white dwarfs, the relativistic
  jets of binary SS 433, the x-ray binary Cyg X-1, and the bright eclipsing
  binaries Algol and e Aurigae on the 61- and, later, 81-cm telescope at the
  Pine Mountain Observatory, of which Kemp was director until his death from
  cancer. His measurement of circularly polarization in the continuum light of
  the white dwarf GJ 742 (Grw +70<sup><font size="2">
        ∘</font>
    </sup> 8247, Kemp et al. 1970b) was an important discovery, and through his
    study of Algol (Kemp et al. 1983; Wilson &amp; Liou 1993), he appears to
    have been the first to discover the limb polarization in eclipsing binaries
    predicted by Chandrasekhar (1946ab).</p>
  <p>Although it has taken twenty years for the BAAS to publish his obituary
  notice, it is somewhat appropriate that his former student, Gary Henson, who
  provided much of the background for this article, is involved with a
  polarimetry team to observe and analyze data from e Aurigae, as it approaches
  ingress of the next primary minimum beginning summer, 2009. The author
  acknowledges with gratitude the additional assistance of T. A. Clark and R. E.
  Wilson in preparing this article.</p>
