  <p>Judy Young, one of the leading researchers in extragalactic molecular
  observations, died on 23 May 2014 after a long battle with cancer. Her
  pioneering galactic structure research included some of the earliest mapping
  of CO emission in galaxies followed by the most extensive surveys molecular
  gas and star formation in nearby galaxies. Judy was also a popular professor
  and leader of outreach efforts in the Department of Astronomy at the
  University of Massachusetts, Amherst where she had been since 1979.</p>

  <p>Judy was born 15 September 1952 to Bob and Vera Rubin. She attended
  Radcliffe/Harvard University, where she received her BA in 1974. She completed
  her PhD degree in Physics at the University of Minnesota on “The Isotopic
  Composition of Cosmic Rays” under the guidance of Phyllis Freier. She then
  came to the Five College Radio Observatory at the University of Massachusetts
  as a Postdoctoral Fellow in 1979. After three years she was appointed to the
  teaching faculty at University of Massachusetts (Amherst) and full professor
  in 1993. She also spent sabbaticals in Arizona and at the University of
  Hawaii. She received numerous awards, including the Annie Jump Cannon Prize
  (1982), the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award (1986) of the American Astronomical
  Society and a Sloan Research Fellowship (1986-1989). Judy published more than
  130 papers and supervised 5 Ph.D. students and 15 undergraduate research
  projects.</p>

  <p>Judy’s major area of astronomical research was extragalactic observations
  of star-forming molecular gas using CO lines and related observations of star
  formation tracers in blue light, H-alpha emission, and the infrared continuum.
  Her molecular observations were made with the 14 m single dish FCRAO
  telescope. The initial imaging of nearby spiral galaxies, in collaboration
  with Nick Scoville, then at UMass, first clearly demonstrated the
  proportionality of the star formation rate surface density to the molecular
  gas. They also first showed the efficacy of using the CO emission line as a
  tracer of the molecular gas mass. Subsequent surveys of CO and star formation
  led by Judy were conducted with her PhD students and postdocs over the
  following decades – 1982-2001. These projects included a survey with Linda
  Tacconi of late-type spirals and dwarf galaxies; an extensive survey probing
  the depletion of HI and H2 in Virgo cluster galaxies with Jeff Kenney; and
  some of the first observations of CO in ULIRG galaxies with Dave Sanders and
  Nick Scoville. She also led the FCRAO Extragalactic CO Survey, having major
  participation from Nick Devereux, Pat Knezek, Shuding Xie, and Lori Allen in
  addition to those mentioned earlier. This survey included CO mapping for 300
  low-redshift galaxies; and despite the enormous number of objects, it was a
  characteristic of Judy to know every detail of each galaxy and to love them as
  family.</p>

  <p>Judy was also deeply committed to outreach activities. In 1992 Judy
  initiated the UMass Sunwheel Project – her plan to build a Stonehenge-like
  circle of standing stones marking the rising and setting sun at the equinoxes
  and solstices as a way to teach about celestial motions (<a
  href="http://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/">http://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/</a>). It
  took almost 5 years of negotiating for space on campus, taking careful
  measurements, and gaining support from the Healey Foundation, before she was
  able to install a ring of 2-foot stones in 1997 and began making solstice and
  equinox presentations. By 2000, with private donations and NSF support, Judy
  erected a ring of 8-to-10 foot tall granite rocks, marking motions of both the
  Sun and Moon. For this work Judy received the University’s Distinguished
  Academic Outreach Award in 2000. Even as Judy grew weak from multiple myeloma,
  she continued to lead sunrise and sunset events at the Sunwheel as late as the
  summer solstice of 2013. The Sunwheel continues to be a popular attraction
  near the campus football stadium, marrying Judy’s appreciation of spiritual
  aspects and understandings from native American culture, a love of nature, and
  her desire to communicate our scientific understanding to non-scientists.</p>

  <p>Judy is survived by her daughter Laura, her mother Vera Rubin, and
  brothers David, Karl and Allan Rubin.</p>
