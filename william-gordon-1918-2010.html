  <p>Bill Gordon was born in Paterson, New Jersey on January 8, 1918,
  and died in Ithaca, New York, on February 16, 2010. He is known as the
  engineer and ionospheric physicist who conceived and built the Arecibo giant
  radar/radio telescope. Bill graduated from Montclair State College in New
  Jersey and then in 1953 received his doctorate degree from Cornell University
  in electrical engineering, working under Henry Booker. During World War II he
  was in the Army where he studied the atmospheric conditions that affected
  radar transmissions.</p>
  
  <p>In the mid 1950s he began investigating giant antennas capable of
  studying the earths ionosphere. He succeeded in raising funds from the US
  Defense Department to construct the 1000 ft in diameter radar/radio
  telescope near the city of Arecibo on the island of Puerto Rico. The
  telescope was completed in 1963 under Bill’s management, and he was its
  first Director.</p>
  
  <p>The huge fixed spherical antenna surface was made of a thin wire mesh
  allowing it to operate at frequencies up to about 600 MHz (50 cm
  wavelength). The spherical surface required complex ‘line feeds’ to
  correct for the spherical aberration, but allowed the telescope to track
  celestial radio sources by moving the line feeds which were supported by a
  platform suspended 500 ft above the reflector surface. Its sky coverage
  declination range was from -2 to +38 degrees. The large collecting area of
  the telescope made possible the detailed study of the physical properties
  of the earth’s ionosphere. Measurements also included the rotation rates
  of the planets Mercury and Venus, radar imaging of the Moon and
  terrestrial planets. This new magastructure operated at low frequencies
  with its prime frequency at 430 MHz.</p>

  <p>One of Bill’s passions was to make controlled experiments with the
  ionosphere. These so called ‘heating experiments’, used a powerful HF
  radar transmitting from 5 to 10 MHz, to heat the ionosphere near the
  plasma frequency. The Arecibo radar then would study the heated
  atmospheric section to investigate the changes in the physical parameters
  of the ionosphere.</p>

  <p>Bill Gordon, in 1966, moved to Rice University in Houston, Texas, where
  he was a Distinguished Professor and Senior Administrator (Dean, Provost
  and Vice President).</p>

  <p>The Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory in 1970 was designated as ‘The
  National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center ‘ (NAIC), and began to be funded
  as a National Center by the National Science Foundation. Cornell has
  remained the managing institution since that time. Early in the 1970s a
  grant from the NSF made it possible to replace the surface of the
  telescope with perforated rigid panels allowing it to operate at least up
  to 5000 MHz. In the 1990s the long imperfect line feeds were replaced by a
  complex Gregorian system that greatly increased the sensitivity of the
  telescope. This allowed the radiation to be collected at a focal point
  rather than via a long line. These and other major improvements have kept
  the telescope as the most sensitive radio/radar telescope in the
  world.</p>

  <p>Observations of pulsars at Arecibo resulted in the 1993 Nobel Prize in
  Physics to Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse who indirectly showed that
  gravitational waves exist, as Albert Einstein’s general theory of
  relativity predicts. In 1990 Aleksander Wolszczan discovered a special
  pulsar and he was able to show that it was surrounded by earth size
  planets. The exotic and photogenic giant radar/radio telescope has also
  been featured in prominent movies such as the James Bond ‘Goldeneye’ in
  1995, and Carl Sagan’s ‘Contact’ in 1997.</p>

  <p>Bill’s many graduate students from Cornell and Rice, simply adored him.
  One of his students, Dr. Richard A. Behnke, has said ‘Simply he was the
  greatest man I have known’. Bill was married to Elva Freile Gordon for 61
  years. Elva died in 2001. Bill later remarried with Elizabeth Bolgiano
  Gordon.</p>

  <p>In his career Bill received many awards. He was a member of the
  National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, and
  he also received several honorary Gold medals, including the Balth van der
  Pol Gold Medal from URSI, and the Arctowski Gold Medal of the National
  Academy of Sciences.</p>
