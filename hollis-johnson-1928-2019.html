      <h1>Hollis Ralph Johnson (1928-2019)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p><strong>Hollis R. Johnson died on Monday the 15<sup>th</sup> of April,
  2019.</strong></p>

  <p>The astronomical community will remember Hollis R. Johnson not only for
  the excellence of his groundbreaking research but also for his personal
  warmth and enthusiasm. Through his kindness and wisdom, he made everyone
  around him better people, as well as better astronomers.</p>

  <p>Born in 1928, Hollis grew up in Garland, Utah, where the dark, starry
  nights inspired his interest in astronomy. He served in the Army Message
  Corps in the early 1950s, stationed in Germany. While in Europe, Hollis met
  his future bride, Grete Margit Leed in Denmark, and they married in
  1954.</p>

  <p>Hollis completed an undergraduate degree in physics in 1955 and a
  master’s degree in physics in 1957, both at Brigham Young University. He
  then entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and
  earned a Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1960 for his dissertation in solar physics
  titled “Helium Equilibrium in the Solar Atmosphere.” Following post-doctoral
  positions at the Paris Observatory and at Yale University, Hollis was
  recruited to Indiana University by Frank Edmondson and Marshall Wrubel.
  During his early years on the faculty, Hollis continued his research on the
  Sun, particularly on the temperatures and densities in the solar
  chromosphere and corona.</p>

  <p>Hollis then switched his focus to the study of the atmospheres of other
  stars, especially cool, red giant stars, whose atmospheres are riddled with
  molecules that contribute significant opacity. His 1980 paper with Bernat
  and Krupp (Johnson et al. 1980, ApJS, 42, 501) demonstrated the importance
  of water vapor opacity at effective temperatures as low as 2500 K, and
  explored the validity of standard assumptions about plane parallel geometry,
  microturbulence, and neglect of turbulent pressure when modeling the
  extended atmospheres of these cool stars. His paper with Sauval (Johnson and
  Sauval 1982, AApS, 49, 77) computed molecular equilibria in red giant
  atmospheres. They considered 1600 different atomic and molecular species
  formed by the combination of 83 chemical elements and evaluated column
  densities to determine the importance of each in red giant spectra. This
  involved a pioneering effort in the use of high performance computers to
  model these complex stellar atmospheres. Their computations of the column
  densities for dozens of diatomic and triatomic molecules as a function of
  effective temperature still provide a useful guide for what might appear in
  a red giant spectrum.</p>

  <p>During the 1980s, Hollis began using the International Ultraviolet
  Explorer satellite (and later, the Hubble Space Telescope) to study the
  ultraviolet spectra of cool stars, collaborating widely with astronomers
  from around the world. Hollis used his expertise on the atmospheres of cool
  stars to examine the properties, compositions, and chromospheres of red
  giants, supergiants, and carbon stars, and was widely recognized
  internationally for his leadership in this field.</p>

  <p>During his years on the faculty at Indiana University, Hollis directed
  sixteen doctoral dissertations, mentored numerous postdocs, and taught at
  all levels. Hollis particularly enjoyed close working relationships with his
  graduate students. His graduate courses on solar physics, and later, stellar
  atmospheres, became legendary. He excelled equally at teaching introductory
  courses for non-science majors, especially elementary education majors, and
  also excelled at teaching more advanced courses for astronomy majors. He was
  a compelling classroom presence. He also enjoyed working with school
  children and gave many public lectures around the State of Indiana. Hollis
  chaired the Department of Astronomy at Indiana University twice, and served
  on a variety of campus committees. He was also President of the campus
  chapter of Sigma Xi. For many years, Hollis represented Indiana University
  on the Board of Directors of the Association of Universities for Research in
  Astronomy and served on the Observatories Visiting Committee. Hollis was
  especially proud of organizing IAU Colloquium 106, “The Evolution of
  Peculiar Red Giant Stars,” in 1988. The Colloquium brought many
  distinguished visitors to Bloomington, and led to a deeper understanding of
  the evolutionary connections of the diverse classes of peculiar red giants.
  Hollis chaired the IAU working group on Peculiar Red Giant Stars from
  1988-1991 and served the IAU in a variety of other capacities, as well.</p>

  <p>No discussion of Hollis’ life would be complete without mentioning his
  devotion to The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints, including service
  as bishop, stake president, and counselor. Hollis undertook an extended
  mission in Denmark in 1948-1951, and Hollis and Greta undertook three
  18-month missions in Denmark, Ghana, and China after Hollis’ retirement from
  Indiana University in 1994.</p>

  <p>In addition to these many professional and service accomplishments,
  Hollis projected delight in his interactions with everyone, and he did much
  to promote a love for astronomy. Just getting a hearty greeting from Hollis
  in the hallway could buoy your spirits. His colleagues and former students
  will remember him fondly.</p>
