  <p>Geoffrey R. Burbidge, one of the principal architects of 20th century
  astrophysics, died in La Jolla, California on January 26, 2010. Together with
  his wife and life-long collaborator, Margaret Burbidge and several leading
  astrophysicists, he originated ideas that remain at the core of current
  astrophysical research. He was, of course, co-author of B2FH (Burbidge,
  Burbidge, Fowler, &amp; Hoyle 1957), one of the most influential scientific
  papers ever written, which explained how elements heavier than helium are
  synthesized in the interiors of stars. Geoff Burbidge’s research interests
  spanned a wide range of topics. He was the first to estimate the colossal
  energetics of extragalactic radio sources. Together with Margaret and Kevin
  Prendergast he initiated the first systematic program to measure the masses of
  galaxies from their rotation curves. He published research that effectively
  began the field of “active galactic nuclei”, and he made the fundamental
  suggestion that galactic X-ray sources were powered by viscous transport of
  energy in accretion disks surrounding neutron stars or black holes in binary
  star systems. After the discovery of quasars in 1963, he wrote influential
  papers on gravitational collapse as their energy source and an excellent book
  summarizing research on this subject. During the latter part of his career
  Geoff Burbidge became known as the “great contrarian” who remained skeptical
  about the cosmological origin of quasar redshifts and rejected the big bang
  theory. He was author of 355 publications.</p>

  <p>Geoff was born in 1925 September in Chipping Norton Oxfordshire, where he
  grew up and developed a lifelong passion for tennis. He attended the yearly
  matches at Wimbledon with his father, a ritual he maintained for most of his
  life. In 1946 he got his undergraduate degree in physics at the University of
  Bristol. After graduating he was assigned for eighteen months to a government
  ballistics laboratory in London where he became an expert in testing
  penetration bombs and other types of demolition devices, and where he decided
  to pursue a graduate career in physics. In 1947 he began studying theoretical
  physics with H. Massey at University College London and received his PhD in
  physics in 1950 with a thesis concerning capture of muons by atoms. During his
  stay in London, Geoff ’s interest in astronomy was sparked upon meeting his
  future wife, Margaret Peachey, who was the Assistant Director of the
  University of London Observatory; they married in 1948. Margaret was working
  on spectral variations in Be stars, and Geoff collaborated with her by
  participating in her observing runs and in performing theoretical analysis,
  beginning a unique and famous scientific partnership that lasted over 60
  years.</p>

  <p>After Geoff obtained his PhD, he and Margaret went to the U.S. in 1951, he
  to Harvard and she to Yerkes Observatory. Between 1951 and 1957 the Burbidges
  held research appointments at Cambridge University, Carnegie Observatories,
  and Caltech. Between 1957 and 1962 Geoff and Margaret held faculty positions
  at the University of Chicago Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. Between 1959 and
  1969, Geoff, Margaret, and their Yerkes colleague Kevin Prendergast carried
  out the first comprehensive investigation of galaxy masses. Geoff Burbidge,
  along with Margaret, joined the faculty of the University of California, San
  Diego in 1962, where, except for short stints back in the U.K. and his
  directorship of Kitt Peak National Observatory, he stayed until he passed
  away. Burbidge’s research focused on quasars after their discovery in 1963. He
  participated in the discovery of quasar absorption lines in 1966, which led to
  much fruitful research concerning the foreground absorbing gas</p>

  <p>Burbidge also contributed in many other ways to the astronomical community.
  He was editor of Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics (i.e., ARAA)
  from 1973 to 2004. The editorial committees regarded him as an excellent
  editor who kept his scientific prejudices out of the discussions and who was
  mainly responsible for the superb reputation of this journal. He was Director
  of Kitt Peak National Observatory from 1978 to 1984, where he carried out much
  needed reforms, and scientific editor of the Astrophysical Journal from 1995
  to 2001. He also served on several committees including chairmanship of the
  Astronomical Advisory Committee for the National Science Foundations in
  1966-1967. He was on the board of the Association of Universities for Research
  in Astronomy from 1970 to 1974, the organization that administers Kitt Peak
  National Observatory, Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, and Sacramento
  Peak Observatory. From 1972 to 1982, he was a board member of the Associated
  Universities Inc., which administers the Brookhaven National Laboratory and
  the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.</p>

  <p>Geoff and Margaret were recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal
  Astronomical Society in 2005. He received the Catherine Bruce Gold Medal of
  the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1999 and the Jansky Prize of the
  National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1985. In 1959, he and Margaret
  received the Warner Prize of the American Astronomical Association. He was
  also a fellow of the Royal Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
  the American Physical Society, and the University of London.</p>

  <p>Geoff exhibited two outstanding traits. First, he had a high sense of
  personal integrity. This was evident in the editorial sessions of the ARAA.
  When deciding who should be asked to write a review article about a specific
  topic, he would usually favor the person with the best scientific reputation,
  even if he disagreed with the scientific opinions of that individual. When
  adjudicating personal conflicts, Geoff was neither swayed by institutional
  prestige nor the seniority of the participants. Rather, he tried to get at the
  core of the truth, even if that meant sticking up for the underdog against
  more powerful voices.</p>

  <p>Geoff had another admirable quality: he was loyal to his friends. He could
  always be counted on for support no matter how difficult the circumstances.
  This is the characteristic that this author will miss the most.</p>
