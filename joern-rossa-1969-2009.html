      <h1>Joern Rossa (1969-2009)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Jörn Rossa (often spelled Joern Rossa) passed away on September 19, 2009 at
  the young age of 40 in Mainz, Germany from a virulent fast-acting blood
  cancer. He was born in that same city on March 17, 1969 to Alfred and Gudrun
  Rossa, who survive their only child.</p>

  <p>Joern had a deep, lifelong love of astronomy, as evidenced by the
  handwritten letters he wrote in his youth to prominent astronomers and
  astronauts for their perspectives, signatures and reprints, the popular
  astronomy magazines which he collected for decades, the decision to abandon a
  career as a locomotive driver and relearn the math and physics required to
  pursue his passion, the many papers he published himself, and the numerous
  space shuttle launches he made a point to personally attend at Kennedy Space
  Center. Since High School, Joern carried out observations using his own
  telescope, traveled with friends to remote locations to practice "serious"
  astrophotography, and lectured at a local amateur club.</p>

  <p>After attaining his undergraduate degree at the University of Heidelberg
  (Germany) in 1996, Joern continued his education at the Ruhr-University Bochum
  in Germany, where he worked under the guidance of Ralf-Juergen Dettmar. He
  received his Ph.D. degree in 2001 with a thesis focusing on extraplanar
  diffuse ionized gas and dust in the halos of edge-on spiral galaxies. He
  performed the largest-to-this-day ground-based H-alpha survey of a large
  number of galaxies, quantified their extraplanar ISM, and correlated its
  properties with the starburst activity in the galaxy disk. After his
  graduation, Joern stayed in Bochum for another year as a Postdoctoral
  Associate. During this time he expanded his interests in the same general
  subject area through the use of X-ray (XMM, Chandra) and radio observations.
  His interest in the ISM of nearby galaxies continued through his subsequent
  postdoctoral career. He analyzed high-spatial resolution Hubble Space
  Telescope (HST) WFPC2 H-alpha data of the edge-on non-starburst spiral galaxy
  NGC 891. The data revealed for the first time super-thin filaments, which may
  indicate an important role of the magnetic fields in the gas and for mass
  transfer. He then received time with HST/ACS to study four other galaxies to
  greater depth and resolution. Joern also obtained narrow-band imaging data at
  Calar Alto Observatory of a sample of Seyfert galaxies, and he supervised a
  summer student at STScI on the analysis of this sample. Joern's observational
  work in these areas led to a better understanding of the physical processes
  that drive gas out of galaxy disks.</p>

  <p>After his appointment in Bochum, Joern moved to the Space Telescope Science
  Institute (STScI) in 2002 in Baltimore, where he worked for four years as a
  postdoctoral researcher with Roeland van der Marel. During this time he
  studied and analyzed two different sets of HST data. The first project dealt
  with the nature of nuclear star clusters found in the centers of spiral
  galaxies. To study the physical properties of these clusters (e.g., masses,
  stellar population ages, etc.) and their formation mechanisms, spectra were
  obtained with HST/STIS of a sample of nuclear clusters in spiral galaxies of
  various Hubble types. Joern analyzed and interpreted the data, which led to
  the realization that the stellar populations of these nuclear clusters are
  often young -- indicating still on-going star formation processes -- and that
  the cluster mass correlates with bulge mass in a similar fashion as does the
  mass of supermassive black holes. The second focus of Joern's work at STScI
  was the nuclear properties of merger remnants. He used HST/NICMOS to obtain
  near-IR images and optical spectroscopy of the merging galaxies in the Toomre
  sequence. The near-IR images penetrate the dusty parts of these galaxies and
  allowed measurement of the surface brightness profiles down to scales of order
  0.1 arcsec. The steepness of the brightness profiles was found to be
  consistent with scenarios in which merger remnants evolve into
  ellipticals.</p>

  <p>Joern then moved to the University of Florida (UF) in 2006 to work as a
  core team member of the Flamingos 2 Extra-Galactic Survey. This survey aims at
  deriving the star formation histories, masses and metallicities of star
  formation galaxies at redshifts between 2.0-2.5 and also at deriving the
  properties (e.g., black hole masses) of AGN and at studying the optically
  obscured AGN at intermediate to high redshifts (z &gt; 1.5). Joern was largely
  responsible for the target selection strategies for both samples (star-forming
  galaxies and AGN), for coordinating the weekly group meetings, and for
  designing a web-page for the extragalactic group. He was interested in using
  the survey to answer several cosmological questions in collaboration with
  Vicki Sarajedini, Rafael Guzmän, Fred Hamann, Anthony Gonzalez, the
  Flamingos-2 instrument PI, Stephen Eikenberry (all from UF), and with
  additional collaborators from the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain.
  Joern also worked with Vicki Sarajedini on SED fitting of variability-selected
  AGN in the Chandra Deep Field South. Joern was a very versatile observer,
  complementing his belief that understanding of the star-formation activity in
  galaxies can be only achieved through a multi-wavelength study of various
  galaxy types.</p>

  <p>In addition to research, Joern had a strong desire to be involved in the
  logistical aspects of science. At STScI he participated in the support group
  for the time allocation committee and at UF he was the postdoctoral
  representative of the space allocation committee. He photographed the UF staff
  for the departmental webpage and was a designated photographer at a local
  conference and other events. He also participated in the public Museum nights
  at UF. He was always eager to provide his feedback on the scientific and
  practical issues of astronomy and filled in many surveys distributed to the
  astronomical community.</p>

  <p>His colleagues and friends could always count on Joern to be extremely
  responsive, punctual, organized, polite and truthful; he did not tolerate
  false flattery and he held strongly to his own beliefs. Joern ardently loved
  his family and was faithful to his friends. Joern had several passions outside
  of astronomy. Among these were music, travel, snorkeling and photography. He
  played guitar and idolized Fleetwood Mac, The Eagles, and Tom Petty, among
  many other artists. While visiting 45 U.S. States and many other countries,
  Joern had a knack for picking up languages and spoke impeccable English.</p>

  <p>We will miss Joern, a loyal son, friend and colleague.</p>
