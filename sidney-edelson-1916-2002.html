  <p>On 24 March 2002, the solar physicist Sidney Edelson died in Santa Barbara,
  California. Sidney was born in Brooklyn NY on 24 August 1916 to Benjamin and
  Sarah Edelson. His father worked in the garment industry. He obtained his BA
  from Brooklyn College (1938) and a MA from New York University (1949). He
  entered Georgetown University in 1950 and received both a MA (1953) and PhD
  (1961). His PhD thesis was entitled ``A Study of Long and Short Term
  Variations in Solar Radiation at Radio and Optical Wavelengths."</p>

  <p>When the U.S. entered World War II, Sidney enlisted as an apprentice seaman
  and retired as a Lt Commander. He was active in both the European and Pacific
  theaters. He was captain of a minesweeper in the northern Atlantic and
  commanded a LST vehicle landing troops at Normandy on Omaha beach. Later on,
  he was part of the amphibious forces that landed the 5th Marine Division at
  Okinawa. After the war, he commanded the USS Typhon repatriating Japanese POWs
  from China to Sasebo, Japan. For this, he was given a certificate of
  appreciation by Chiang Kaishek.</p>

  <p>After the war efforts, he served in 1946-47 as a port captain for the China
  Waterways Transport in Shanghai. It was at this time that he met and married
  Erny Margaret Anderson, a surgical nurse. They were unable to have children
  because of a bayonet wound suffered by Erny during a 1937 Japanese attack upon
  the Catholic Mission hospital where she was working.</p>

  <p>The majority of his research work was in the area of solar physics; he
  noted the time relationships between centimeter wavelength bursts and Halpha
  solar flares (1959), studied the short term variations in the solar radiation
  at radio and optical wavelengths (1961), observed the solar flux variations at
  mm and cm radio wavelengths (1973), and pointed out the close association of
  the emission features at 9 and 3.3 mm with the solar magnetic field structure
  (1973).</p>

  <p>Sidney's professional career included research work on solar physics at a
  number of institutions including the U.S. Naval Observatory (1948-56), the
  U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (1956-1964), NASA Ames Research Center
  (1964-1972) and the University of Graz Austria (1972-1974). During the period
  1975-1985, he acted as a consultant for solar energy initiatives and in
  1978-1981, he served as a volunteer science advisor for Congressman Robert
  Lagomarsino in Santa Barbara California. Upon the death of his wife Erny in
  1992, he endowed two Erny Margaret Edelson memorial scholarships at Santa
  Barbara City College, one in nursing and one in radiography. In honor of Carl
  Sagan, he endowed a third scholarship in planetary sciences. Also in honor of
  his wife, he donated ancient works of Chinese art to the Santa Barbara Museum
  of Art.</p>

  <p>One of the activities for which he was most proud was his support, at Ames,
  of the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission, an activity for which he received an
  Apollo Achievement Award. He had both a distinguished military career and a
  successful scientific career. Sidney's siblings are his brothers Leon and Jack
  Edelson and his sisters, Edith Caballero, Dr. Terry Smolar, and Sophia Forman
  (now deceased).</p>
