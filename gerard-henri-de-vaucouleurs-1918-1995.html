      <h1>Gerard Henri de Vaucouleurs (1918-1995)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Gerard de Vaucouleurs was born on 25 April 1918 in Paris. He became
  interested in astronomy in 1932 when his mother bought him a small telescope,
  and, after reading books by Th. Moreux, he decided he wanted to be a
  professional astronomer. He received his BSc in 1936 from the Lycee
  Charlemagne in Paris, and went to the University of Paris (the Sorbonne) from
  1937-1939 for training in physics, astronomy, and mathematics.</p>

  <p>Starting in 1939 Gerard briefly worked at the private observatory of Julien
  Peridier in southern France. But two months later, with the growing war,
  Peridier closed the observatory and Gerard returned to Paris. In 1943, Gerard
  enrolled again at the University of Paris to work on his doctoral degree with
  Jean Cabannes, and graduated in the spring of 1949 with a dissertation on
  molecular (Rayleigh) scattering of light in gases and liquids.</p>

  <p>Gerard met his first wife, Antoinette, in the spring of 1944. This was the
  beginning of a life together dedicated to astronomy. They were married in
  October 1944, two months after the Allied liberation of Paris. As a student he
  published several books on photography, atomic energy, and astronomy; his
  research in photography was motivated by his growing interest to study
  galaxies. With the Haute Provence reflectors, he and Antoinette did surface
  photometry of galaxies with the Chalonge microphotometer. It is this work
  which led to the formulation of the famous de Vaucouleurs law for the
  luminosity distribution of elliptical galaxies in 1948.</p>

  <p>Gerard did not see a future in extragalactic astronomy in France, so he and
  Antoinette went abroad, staying first in England and then moving to the
  Australian National University in Canberra, attracted by the 74- inch
  Grubb-Parsons reflector at Mount Stromlo. Gerard wrote to Richard Woolley, the
  director of the observatory and in 1951 became the first research fellow in
  astronomy at ANU to perform radial velocity studies of galaxies in the
  unexplored southern sky.</p>

  <p>In 1954, Gerard left ANU to become observer-in-charge of the new Yale
  Southern Station. Dirk Brouwer, director of the Yale University Observatory,
  had moved the venerable 26-inch refractor there, but it took a few years to
  solve all the technical problems associated with this move, which occupied
  much of Gerard's time. In March 1957 Gerard left to take a new position at the
  Lowell Observatory to continue his studies of galaxies as well as Mars. With
  Harold Johnson, Gerard began a long-term program of UBV photometry of
  galaxies, but soon moved to Harvard in 1958, concentrating on Mars and other
  planets. At Harvard he planned a precision mapping project of Martian features
  that was later used by NASA for the Mariner 9 mission.</p>

  <p>In 1960, Gerard left Harvard for the University of Texas astronomy
  department, where he spent the next 35 years. He and Antoinette quickly began
  observing galaxies at McDonald Observatory. They were one of the most
  productive husband/wife teams in astronomy until Antoinette's untimely death
  in 1987.</p>

  <p>Extragalactic observational astronomy and cosmology occupied most of
  Gerard's career. In 1953 he demonstrated that the Milky Way is part of a
  large, flattened system of galaxies whose peak density lies in the direction
  of the Virgo Cluster. From the plane of this "Local Supercluster," he
  established a system of supergalactic coordinates which has been used
  extensively by specialists who analyze the distribution of nearby galaxies. In
  the same year Gerard argued that the Magellanic Clouds were not "irregular"
  galaxies but were actually a well-defined class of rotating barred spiral with
  a specific type of asymmetry.</p>

  <p>Gerard and Antoinette produced a series of highly useful galaxy catalogs.
  The first, <em>Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies</em> (or RC1), published
  in 1964, was a monumental effort to collect and homogenize all relevant basic
  data on 2,599 bright galaxies. The cataloging work continued over the next 25
  years with the production of a second catalogue (RC2) in 1976 and a third
  (RC3) in 1991. The first two reference catalogues set the stage for de
  Vaucouleurs' biggest career effort, a re-evaluation of the problem of the
  extragalactic distance scale. At the time, in the mid- to-late 70s, Allan
  Sandage and Gustav Tammann presented their evidence for a Hubble constant of
  50 km/s/mpc. Between 1976-79, Gerard presented evidence from a variety of
  primary, secondary, and tertiary distance indicators for a Hubble constant
  closer to 100 km/s/mpc. For years the discrepancy in estimates persisted. The
  issue was not resolved at the time of Gerard's death.</p>

  <p>Gerard built an optical Fabry-Perot interferometer at McDonald Observatory,
  and used it to obtain detailed velocity fields of bright galaxies. His
  "Galaxymeter" was well-known among his students and colleagues as an
  instrument designed to do almost anything on galaxies, from UBV multiaperture
  photometry to radial velocities, direct photography, narrow-band imaging and
  interferometry.</p>

  <p>Gerard's enormous impact as a researcher included his influence as a
  teacher and mentor. He was strongly committed to his students and expected
  total commitment from them. When Gerard and a colleague were working on a
  topic that others were also working on or had worked on, he would always say
  that "We can do it better." This was a guiding principle in his life.</p>

  <p>Gerard often entertained students and colleagues at home with slide shows
  of their many travels. Although he was very forceful and consequently quite
  opinionated, Gerard was a caring individual. He kept up with the literature
  much more than most of his colleagues. He was always genuinely interested in
  what others were doing, and had great appreciation for any work involving
  basic data on galaxies.</p>

  <p>Although well into his seventies, Gerard still attended and participated in
  scientific meetings when he could. He was accompairied to meetings by his
  second wife, Elysabeth, whom he had married in 1988. At a 1994 meeting in
  Lyons, he was as active and dynamic as ever, and seemed in good health.
  Shortly thereafter he was to attend another meeting in Europe, and it was
  around this time that he developed serious health problems. During the next
  year, Elysabeth exhausted herself taking care of him as his health steadily
  deteriorated, and she was with him at their home in Austin when he died on
  October 7, 1995.</p>

  <p>At the time of his death, Gerard was writing a book on SN 1885 (S
  Andromedae) in M31, and was compiling a detailed collection of photometric
  observations of SN 1993J in M81. He had spent 9 years working on the S
  Andromedae book, and told his wife Elysabeth that it was more than 90%
  completed. Both studies should be published in the near future.</p>

  <p>Gerard de Vaucouleurs will long be remembered for his science, for his
  compassion, his caring, and for his love for astronomy. He left behind an
  enduring legacy for his colleagues and former students, and standards for all
  astronomers to follow and live up to. We may never see someone like him again,
  for, as Frank Bash once put it, he was one of the last of the great true
  astronomers. We are all better for having known him, worked with him, and
  learned from him.</p>

  <p>A summary of research appeared as: <em>Gerard and Antoinette de
  Vaucouleurs: A Life for Astronomy</em>, edited by M. Capaccioli and H. G.
  Corwin, Jr., Singapore: World Scientific Press, 1989. An obituary appeared in
  <em>Physics Today</em>, April 1996, 76. The author and E. de Vaucouleurs have
  copies of an unpublished autobiographical memoir: "Through Long Nights ....
  Reminiscing a Cosmic Career" as told to Robert V. Reeves.</p>
