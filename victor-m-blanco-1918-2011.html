  <p>Victor Manuel Blanco, director of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
  Observatory in La Serena, Chile, from 1967 to 1980, built CTIO into a leading
  observatory in the Southern Hemisphere and made it a model for successful
  national and international observatories. He died on 8 March 2011 in Vero
  Beach, Florida.</p>

  <p>Born 10 March 1918 in Guayama, Puerto Rico, Victor
  received his primary, secondary, and initial university education on the
  island. He was interested in astronomy from a young age, but only after taking
  an elective course in it from a physics graduate student did he realize he
  could make a living at it. He saved enough funds from making furniture (a
  hobby he maintained throughout his life) to attend the University of Chicago
  for one quarter in 1939. The university offered him a scholarship and helped
  him find an off-campus job so he could continue his studies. In 1941, while he
  was working as a night assistant at McDonald Observatory, he was drafted into
  the US Army. His various posts with the army included being a meteorologist in
  Pacific war zones, briefing pilots on expected conditions.</p>

  <p>Upon
  release from the army in 1946, Victor returned to the University of Chicago,
  which gave credit for his wartime meteorology courses so that he could obtain
  his bachelor’s degree and begin graduate studies. He subsequently left Chicago
  for the University of California, Berkeley, where Robert Trumpler was his
  adviser; his PhD thesis (1949) was entitled “Luminosity function and space
  distribution of A0 stars.” Victor returned to the University of Puerto Rico to
  teach physics and astronomy, but a lack of funds forced the university to
  eliminate his position after only a year.</p>

  <p>In 1950 Victor joined the
  faculty at the Case Institute of Technology. With Jason Nassau, he used Case’s
  Burrell Schmidt telescope to examine the distribution of late-type stars in
  the Milky Way. Among their findings was that the central bulge region of the
  galaxy was rich in M-type giant stars and poor in carbon stars; however, in
  the galactic anticenter region they occurred in similar numbers. His later
  work at CTIO extended that result.</p>

  <p>Victor left Case in 1965 to
  become head of the astronomy and astrophysics division of the US Naval
  Observatory. In 1967 he accepted the directorship of CTIO, where he spent the
  rest of his career.</p>

  <p>Established in 1961 by the Association of
  Universities for Research in Astronomy with funding from NSF, CTIO was given
  the mission of providing astronomical facilities primarily for US and Latin
  American astronomers. At the time only 10% of the light-gathering power of the
  world’s telescopes was located in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

  <p>When
  Victor arrived in Chile in 1967, CTIO was just completing construction of its
  largest telescope, the 1.5 meter. That same year NSF and the Ford Foundation
  committed to funding construction of a 4-meter telescope now named for Victor.
  It was the Southern Hemisphere’s largest until the completion of the Magellan
  Telescopes and the Very Large Telescope.</p>

  <p>At the time, however,
  Victor faced challenges on every front. He had to hire scientific staff,
  develop infrastructure and logistics for the 4-meter telescope, and establish
  relationships and agreements with the host country at all levels, including
  with the presidency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, customs, universities, and
  local communities. His success in doing so, during a time of change and
  turmoil under three different governments was a singular accomplishment.</p>

  <p>Despite the challenges, Victor built CTIO into a model national and
  international observatory. He recruited a young scientific staff (including
  me) and fostered their development into accomplished researchers,
  instrumentalists, and managers, who carried Victor’s example into
  international leadership roles.</p>

  <p>Victor also successfully integrated
  CTIO into the national fabric of Chile, at both diplomatic and personal
  levels. He worked with Chilean staff to be a good employer and with local
  communities to be a good corporate citizen. I think one of his proudest
  accomplishments was that many Chileans came to regard CTIO as a Chilean
  observatory.</p>

  <p>Victor was very much a hands-on scientist and
  engineer. He continued his research on late-type stars with the Curtis Schmidt
  telescope at CTIO and then with the 4-meter telescope. He showed that the
  ratio of carbon stars to M-type stars was higher in the Magellanic Clouds than
  in our galaxy; we now know that the increased ratio reflects the lower
  abundance of heavier elements in the Magellanic Clouds. He also studied the
  distributions of late-type stars in the galactic bulge and determined the
  apparent brightness at which their numbers peaked along the line of sight; his
  observations yielded information on the distance to the center of the galaxy.
  On the technical front, he was instrumental in the final optical alignment of
  the 4-meter telescope and its commissioning for use by visiting astronomers.
 </p>

  <p>Victor’s many accomplishments made him a world leader in the
  development of ground-based astronomy in the second half of the 20th century.
  He possessed a rare combination of great scientific skills, ability to work
  extremely well within both South and North American cultures, and personal
  warmth. Those qualities, combined with his perseverance, determination, and
  toughness to successfully overcome the multiple challenges of building a
  forefront scientific installation in difficult circumstances, were
  unparalleled.</p>
