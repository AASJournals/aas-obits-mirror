      <h1>Eugene Leimanis (1905-1992)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Eugene Leimanis, applied mathematician and celestial mechanician, was a
  longtime member of the Department of Mathematics of the University of British
  Columbia in Vancouver, BC. He was born in Koceni, Latvia, the son of a
  teacher, and obtained a Masters Degree and First Prize in Mathematics in 1929
  at the University of Latvia. During the 1930s he held a number of positions on
  the Unviersity’s faculty, the last being Docent of Analytical Mechanics and
  Theoretical Astronomy. After World War II he held several temporary positions
  and in 1947 obtained a Ph.D. at the Baltic University in Hamburg. In 1949 he
  emigrated to Canada and joined the above-mentioned Department, where he
  remained until his retirement in 1974. In 1991 he was elected as a foreign
  member of the Latvian Academy of Science.</p>

  <p>Leimanis’s research led to almost one hundred articles and several books.
  The first book (in Latvian) was <em>Theoretical Mechanics</em> (1940), and in
  1965 he published <em>The General Problem of the Motion of Coupled Rigid
  Bodies About a Fixed Point</em> (New York: Springer). At the time of his death
  he had just completed a book-length manuscript entitled <em>Qualitative
  Methods in the Three-body Problem</em>. The three-body problem was perhaps his
  main area of expertise, along with differential equations and analytical
  mechanics.</p>

  <p>In 1942 Leimanis married his former student, Zigrida Gipslis, who survives
  him along with their four daughters and two sons. He was a member of the
  Executive of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. His
  nonmathematical interests included the arts (especially music), philosophy,
  and theology, but his greatest loves were Beethoven and the opera singer
  Renata Tebaldi.</p>

  <p>This obituary is based solely on a detailed “Who’s Who” entry and a list of
  publications.</p>
