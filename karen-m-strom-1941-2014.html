      <h1>Karen M. Strom (1941-2014)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Karen Marie Strom, longtime researcher in the processes of star formation,
  died of a sudden illness on 29 August 2014. Strom was born on 18 August 1941
  in Fairfax, Oklahoma, to Ray Wilson and Lillian Mae (Schurch) Lewallen. She
  received her undergraduate degree from Harvard College in 1964, then worked
  for several years as a research assistant at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
  Observatory before moving in 1969 with her husband, Stephen, and her children
  to the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where she was a research
  associate. In 1972 the family moved to the Kitt Peak National Observatory in
  Tucson, Arizona, and she and Stephen studied star formation and galactic
  structure. At Kitt Peak, Karen led or contributed to numerous papers on T
  Tauri stars and their circumstellar disks, envelopes, and outflows, including
  studies of nebular Herbig-Haro objects. She also carried out research on other
  aspects of stellar evolution, as well as important work investigating the
  stellar populations of other galaxies. She, along with her husband Stephen and
  their colleagues, conducted some of the first infrared surveys of star-forming
  regions and developed early approaches to image processing, work that
  contributed to the development, at NOAO, of the Image Reduction and Analysis
  Facility (IRAF), a general purpose software system for the reduction and
  analysis of astronomical data.</p>

  <p>In 1983, the Stroms left Kitt Peak for the University of Massachusetts at
  Amherst, where Karen served as a Research Professor until her retirement from
  astronomy in 1998. Karen received an honorary Ph.D. in Astronomy in 1995 from
  Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE) in Puebla,
  Mexico. As an astronomer, Karen is perhaps best known for her estimate of the
  lifetimes of circumstellar accretion disks surrounding T Tauri stars in the
  Taurus-Auriga dark cloud (a fundamental constraint on theories of gas-giant
  planet formation,) as well as multi-wavelength studies of the young stellar
  populations in the L1641 region of the Orion A molecular cloud and other
  regions.</p>

  <p>Karen Strom was also an early innovator on the World Wide Web, leading the
  development of one of the first academic departmental websites, which
  highlighted the UMass Amherst and Five College Astronomy Department research.
  She pioneered hypertext for astronomy research and education, including some
  of the first digital publishing of PhD dissertations. She also created the
  first public clickable map for the state of Massachusetts.</p>

  <p>After her retirement from astronomy, Karen traveled worldwide, developed
  websites for Native American artists, consulted on web-based education, and
  resumed her longstanding interest in photography. She is publisher or
  co-publisher of numerous e-books, including <i>Sticks and Stones: an alphabet
  book for the 21st century</i>, and <i>An Armchair Traveler’s Guide to Death
  Valley</i>. Examples of her fine art photography can be found online at <a
  href="http://www.karenstrom.com/">http://www.karenstrom.com/</a>.</p>

  <p>Karen Strom is survived by her husband Stephen, daughters Kathy Huntington
  and Julie Strom, and sons Robert Strom and David Strom. She had six
  grandchildren. Asteroid 4604 Stekarstrom is named in honor of Karen and her
  husband.</p>
