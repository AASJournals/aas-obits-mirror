  <h1>The Early Years</h1>
  <p>Gart Westerhout was born 15 June 1927 in The Hague, The Netherlands. He was
  the son of Gart Westerhout, an architect, and Magda Foppe, an author. His
  interest in astronomy dates from when his father designed a sanitarium for
  tuberculosis patients who could gaze at constellations while lying on their
  backs. Prompted by reading several popular books about astronomy, he became a
  student at Leiden University in 1945. In early 1950 he started research in
  radio astronomy, working with Jan Hendrik Oort on a model of the Galactic
  continuum radiation (Westerhout and Oort 1951, <em>BAN</em> 11, 323), and then
  became heavily involved in the first 21-cm Galactic hydrogen-line studies
  carried out with the Kootwijk Wurzburg antenna. In 1954 he had a five-month
  stint of military service that was cut short when Oort convinced the State
  Council that his work was indispensable to the Observatory. In 1955 he and
  Maarten Schmidt developed the first detailed 21-cm map of the Milky Way that
  showed the first hints of spiral structure in the interstellar gas, revealed
  differential rotation in our Galaxy, and established a revised Galactic
  coordinate system still in use today. After 1956, using the Dwingeloo 25-meter
  radio telescope, Westerhout worked on a major 75-cm survey (Seeger,
  Westerhout, Conway, Hoekema 1965: <em>BAN</em> 18, 11), and carried out early
  work on polarization of the Galactic background radiation. He used the
  Dwingeloo antenna to produce the "Westerhout Radio Catalog" that eventually
  identified 79 sources that were continuum emitters including some of the
  largest star formation regions in the Milky Way. During these exciting times
  at Leiden he was among the youngest in a pioneering group of his
  contemporaries that included Hendrik van de Hulst, Hugo van Woerden, C. Lex
  Muller, Maarten Schmidt, Lodewijk Woltjer, and Charles L. Seeger, Jr. (son of
  the ethnomusicologist and brother of Pete Seeger). Other students included Wim
  Brouw, Mike Davis, Ernst Raimond, Whitney Shane and Jaap Tinbergen. While at
  Leiden University, he held the posts of Assistant (1952–56), Scientific
  Officer (1956–59), and Chief Scientific Officer (1959–62). He was awarded
  Physics and Astronomy degrees from the University of Leiden: Cand. (1950) and
  Drs. (1954) and was awarded a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Physics in 1958. At his
  first IAU General Assembly, at Dublin in 1955, Gart met Judith Monaghan, who
  worked at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; they fell in love and
  were married a year later.</p>

  <h1>The Maryland Years</h1>
  <p>Westerhout came to the US in 1962 as Professor and Director of Astronomy at
  the University of Maryland where, during the next 15 years, he grew a
  12-graduate-student department into one of the nation’s prominent astronomy
  programs. In 1972, Dr. Westerhout organized the University of Maryland's
  division of mathematical, physical and engineering sciences and was named its
  head the next year. He continued his research with a 21-cm survey that used
  the 91-m radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory to extend
  to higher angular resolution our knowledge of Galactic structure. He often
  flew a rented plane between Maryland and Green Bank with his programmer, Heinz
  Wendtland. He continued at Maryland in that role through 1973, with additional
  responsibilities from 1972-73 as Chairman of the Division of Mathematical
  &amp; Physical Sciences and Engineering. He was a Visiting Astronomer at the
  Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany in
  1973-74.</p>

  <h1>The US Naval Observatory Years</h1>
  <p>From 1977-1993 he left the University of Maryland to become the Scientific
  Director of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington DC. While there, he
  guided the evolution of that observatory toward astronomical data obtained
  from telescopes at the Flagstaff station. He initiated the radio astrometry in
  1979 by using the Green Bank interferometer to improve the absolute positions
  of celestial objects by a factor of ten over the optical. It yielded
  measurements of the Earth orientation parameter UT1 that were a factor of four
  better than the PZTs. In the 1980s, he converted to VLBI, again increasing the
  precision by a factor of ten. Again in the 1980s he looked into the use of
  optical long base line astrometry for absolute positions. This now achieves
  about an order of magnitude precision over other ground-based measurement but
  is not as precise as space-based measurements. Again in the 1980s, he
  introduced the use of CCDs at Flagstaff’s parallax program that supplanted the
  use of optical plates, improving the precision by a factor of five. He was
  responsible for a major expansion of the organization and construction of a
  network of five radio telescopes from Florida to Hawaii that measured the
  rotation of the Earth. Westerhout retired in 1993.</p>

  <h1>Westerhout, Personal Recollections and Characteristics of a Warm Friend
  and Colleague</h1>
  <p>Gart Westerhout was an amiable and affable man, a great and noble man, with
  an exceptional sense of humor and an infectious laugh. We wore a bow tie and
  had flamboyance seldom found among his academic colleagues. In his early
  career he smoked cigars, a signature identification. He and Judith became
  American citizens in 1969. They loved to entertain, and their friendships went
  far beyond his profession. He was an avid O-gauge model railroader and
  maintained a detailed layout that took up most of the basement space in his
  home. He was a communicant of St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Church in
  Hampden.</p>

  <h1>Memberships</h1>
  <p>Westerhout was a member of numerous astronomical organizations, including
  the Dutch Astronomical Society, International Astronomical Union (Commissions
  33, 34, 40, 24 &amp; 5), American Astronomical Society (Councilor 1975-78
  &amp; Vice President 1985-87), Royal Astronomical Society and the Astronomical
  Society of the Pacific, International Scientific Radio Union (URSI), and Sigma
  Xi.</p>

  <p>He contributed his scientific and management expertise widely, for example
  to IAU, National Science Foundation (NSF), AAS, National Research Council,
  Associated Universities Inc., Inter-Union Committee for the Allocation of
  Frequencies (IUCAF), URSI, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, MPIfR, MIT's
  Haystack Observatory, Arecibo Observatory, and the National Academy of
  Sciences.</p>

  <h1>Awards</h1>
  <p>Westerhout’s awards and special recognition included a NATO Fellowship, a
  CSIRO (Australia) Fellowship, an Award for the Teaching of Science, Washington
  Academy of Sciences, Humboldt Prize, and listings in: <em>Outstanding
  Educators of America, American Men and Women in Science</em>, and <em>Who's
  Who in America</em>.</p>

  <h1>Bibliography</h1>
  <p>Westerhout was the author of more than 70 scientific papers, reviews and
  reports. In recognition of his life's work, Minor Planet 5105, discovered by
  Edward L. G. Bowell, was renamed Minor Planet Westerhout in 1991.</p>

  <h1>Death</h1>
  <p>Gart Westerhout died of congestive heart failure on October 14, 2012, at
  the age of 85 in his home at the Charlestown Retirement Community, Apt BR 502,
  715 Maiden Choice Lane, Catonsville, MD 21228. He is survived by his wife of
  56 years, the former Judith Monaghan of Catonsville, Maryland; two daughters,
  Magda Westerhout Mobley of Roland Park and Brigit Molony of Catonsville; and
  two sons, Gart Thomas Westerhout in Osugi, Japan, and Julian Westerhout in
  Bloomington, IL, six grandchildren, and one sister, Marianne Thunnissen in The
  Netherlands. Dr. Westerhout had lived for three decades in Adelphi before
  moving to Baltimore and later to Catonsville.</p>
