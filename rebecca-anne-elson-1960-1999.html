  <p>Rebecca A. W. Elson, an astronomer whose work on dense star clusters
  significantly advanced our understanding of cluster dynamics and stellar
  evolution, died on May 19, 1999, from non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the age of 39.
  She was a published poet, a creative researcher, and a colleague of
  extraordinary insight and warmth. Her contributions to our field, and to those
  who work in it, will be sorely missed.</p>

  <p>Born on January 2, 1960, Becky was educated in the schools of Montreal, as
  well as on long summer field trips across Canada with her father, the
  geologist Prof. John Elson. She arrived at Smith College in Massachusetts at
  the age of 16 and, after a genuinely liberal education, part of it spent at St
  Andrews in Scotland, she graduated in 1980. She went on to earn a Masters
  Degree in Physics from the University of British Columbia and the PhD in
  Astronomy from the University of Cambridge in 1986 for a dissertation on
  globular clusters which became the focus of her life's work.</p>

  <p>Becky then received a postdoctoral fellowship at the Institute of Advanced
  Study, Princeton, expecting to work on the first data from the Hubble Space
  Telescope which was due for launch that year. The Challenger explosion
  deferred those plans, although she continued to pursue her cluster research by
  obtaining extensive observations of the globular cluster system in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud using telescopes in Australia. During her first year at the
  Institute, at age 26, she co-authored a definitive article on star clusters
  for the <em>Annual Reviews in Astronomy and Astrophysics</em>. In 1989, she
  was the youngest astronomer to serve on a committee of the US National Academy
  of Sciences decennial review of the field. That same year, she became a Fellow
  of the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College, Harvard University, an
  interdisciplinary center for women scholars. She returned to Cambridge in 1991
  as a member of the research staff of the Institute of Astronomy.</p>

  <p>Becky's work ranged from a search for stars in the halo of our own galaxy
  to regions of rapid star formation halfway across the Universe. She set strong
  limits on the contribution normal stars could make to the Milky Way's dark
  matter halo, using counts from the Hubble Deep Field to rule out a significant
  stellar component. The article describing this work was published on the first
  page of the first volume of the journal, <em>New Astronomy</em>. The same
  paper showed that some of the faintest star-like objects in the HDF image were
  most likely regions of intense star formation a few kiloparsecs across, lying
  at distances up to 6 billion light years from Earth. She was also a key
  participant in the Hubble Medium Deep Survey, a program to collect hundreds of
  images from the Hubble telescope in order to explore the changes in galaxy
  shapes over cosmic time.</p>

  <p>Her principal work, however, focused on globular clusters, the benchmark
  systems against which all theories of star formation and stellar evolution are
  measured. The very broad age spread of the Magellanic clusters (ranging from a
  few million to nearly ten billion years), provides a series of snapshots of
  stellar evolution in progress. Teasing information on the dynamic processes of
  stellar birth, life, and death from this static series of pictures was Becky's
  craft. She made the first measurement of structural parameters for globular
  clusters outside the Local Group of galaxies, and produced a study of the most
  distant globular cluster system ever observed around an elliptical galaxy in
  the Hubble Deep Field. Her determination of the Magellanic cluster ages
  remains a milestone in the field. By mapping the distribution of cluster
  binaries, studying stellar mass segregation, and obtaining the distribution of
  stellar luminosities to very faint magnitudes, she established fundamental
  connections between the evolution of individual stars and the dynamics of the
  clusters as a whole. In the last round of Hubble time allocations, her team at
  Cambridge was awarded one of the largest programs scheduled for an intensive
  study of the Magellanic clusters — 95 orbits with WFPC, NICMOS, and STIS for
  four pairs of clusters with ages of 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 million years.
  At the time of her death, she was finishing the first paper describing this
  work.</p>

  <p>Becky's talents extended far beyond astrophysics, from soccer to poetry.
  She was a keen observer of herself and those around her, with an ability to
  share her observations with humor and gentle irony. While struggling to
  extract useful data on a globular cluster from the first round of (aberrated)
  HST data in which the extended wings of the point spread function scattered
  light all over the image, a frustrated colleague at the adjoining workstation
  threw up his hands and declared, “It's hopeless — it's all wings.” For Becky,
  this remark was inspiration for a poem:</p>

  <p><strong>Aberration</strong><sup>1</sup></p>

  <p>The way they tell it <br/>
    All the stars have wings<br/>
    The sky so full of wings <br/>
    There is no sky <br/>
    And just for a moment<br/>
    You forget <br/>
    The error and the crimped <br/>
    Paths of light <br/>
    And you see it <br/>
    The immense migration <br/>
    And you hear the rush <br/>
    The beating</p>

  <p>In another poem written for her father, recalling the summer field trips
  they spent together in her childhood, she thanked him for “honoring all my
  questions with questions of your own.” Becky learned that lesson well. She
  honored colleagues, family, friends and strangers alike with questions of her
  own, with music and food and poetry and devotion, all uniquely her own. In “We
  Astronomers”<sup>2</sup> she wrote, “We astronomers are nomads, Merchants,
  circus people, All the earth our tent.” We continue our wandering and our
  selling, and the circus goes on, but the tent is a little emptier now, and the
  sky no longer quite so full of wings.</p>
