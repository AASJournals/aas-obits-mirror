  <p>On 10 February 1999, Barry M. Lasker died suddenly following a heart
  attack. Barry was an astronomer for almost 40 years, playing an important role
  in the creation of two of the world's most highly-respected observatories, the
  Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, and the Space Telescope
  Science Institute. His work on the <em>Guide Star Catalog</em> and the
  <em>Digitized Sky Survey</em> significantly influenced the entire field of
  observational astronomy. Just before his untimely death, he learned that the
  American Astronomical Society had awarded him the 1999 Van Biesbroeck Prize in
  recognition of his long-term service to the scientific community. Barry Lasker
  was born on 12 August 1939 in Hartford, Connecticut. He began his career with
  a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Yale in 1961, quickly followed by
  a Master's degree in 1963 and a PhD in 1964 in astrophysics from Princeton.
  After a postdoctoral position at the Hale Observatories in Pasadena from 1965
  to 1967, he became a professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan,
  where he was acknowledged as an excellent teacher, holding this position from
  1967 to 1969. He was offered an opportunity to move to a remote, undeveloped
  part of Chile as one of the first astronomers for a new observatory that was
  to provide the U.S. astronomical community with facilities in the Southern
  Hemisphere. During this time, Barry was as comfortable with a soldering iron
  and wrench as he was performing his own observations on the interstellar
  medium. He was one of the early pioneers in using computers to control
  telescopes and instruments. In addition to his essential role in the
  observatory's construction and commissioning, he and his wife Sharon became an
  integral part df the local community. When their children, Zephrin and Alida,
  became old enough to attend school, they were instrumental in the creation of
  an American-style English-speaking school that was open to all local
  residents. It has since flourished and now has an enrollment of over 700
  students and is highly respected. In 1979, he began work on a major
  competitive proposal to NASA for the Association of Universities for Research
  in Astronomy (AURA) to create a research-oriented institution that would be
  responsible for the operation of the Hubble Space Telescope. Following its
  successful selection, he moved to Baltimore as one of STScI's first scientists
  in 1981. His major task was to design a system for the measurement of the
  positions of stars that the telescope could lock onto and guide with for every
  observation — Hubble recently exceeded 250,000 observations! With typical
  foresight, he organized an effort to obtain photographic plates of the entire
  sky, build a machine to digitize them and use image-processing software to
  detect and measure 20 million stars over the entire sky.</p>

  <p>This <em>Guide Star Catalog</em> was a tremendous success and since
  publication has become the de facto standard for the operation of most
  telescopes and space missions. Recognizing that the digitized images were also
  of great value to the community, he was instrumental in arranging for
  publication of these data on a set of CD-ROMs. The availability of the
  <em>Digitized Sky Survey</em> has revolutionized how astronomers in this
  information age plan observations or find an optical counterpart to sources
  detected at other wavelengths. Anyone with a computer, professional or amateur
  astronomer, teacher or student, can quickly display, manipulate, and measure
  an image of any part of the sky. The value of this survey was demonstrated
  most notably by using the data to investigate the progenitor system of
  Supernova 1987A and the recent optical identification of a gamma-ray burst
  source.</p>

  <p>Always following his thoughts to a logical conclusion, he realized that it
  was necessary to measure new photographic survey plates. In combination with
  the original work, it would allow the creation of a much larger and more
  useful catalog of over 2 billion objects. This would allow serious research on
  the structure of the Galaxy by determining the colors and motions of stars,
  investigate the spatial distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, and
  provide a tool for the operation of the next generation of ground-based
  telescopes and space missions. When it became clear that funding was
  inadequate, he gradually created an international consortium of partners in
  order to carry out this goal. Work on both the <em>Digitized Sky Survey
  II</em> and the <em>Guide Star Catalog II</em> is currently in progress and
  will be completed in 2001. He was always interested in promoting science in
  education, and took an active interest in helping wherever he could. Whenever
  possible, he mentored bright young high school students who came to STScI for
  summer positions, and recruited local college students for part-time
  employment, giving them challenging and interesting tasks. He was also active
  at a local school, where he helped them refurbish and set up a student
  observatory. Barry was a reserved and modest man. He was both a gentleman and
  a scholar in the truest sense of the expression, treating everyone with
  respect and giving freely of his accumulated wisdom and extensive knowledge.
  In addition to being a brilliant, dedicated and selfless scientist, Barry was
  a genuinely good person. He was committed to his family, and interested in and
  helpful to his many friends and colleagues. He was a professional mentor to
  many young scientists, providing advice and usually ending by quoting some
  literary passage, frequently from Dr. Seuss, to illustrate his point. His
  vision and kindness, his scientific and private personality will be greatly
  missed, but his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of those who were
  privileged to know him and work with him.</p>
