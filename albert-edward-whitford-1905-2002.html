<div>
  <p>Albert E. Whitford, dean of modern photoelectric photometry, died in
  Madison, Wisconsin on 28 March 2002, following a brief illness. He was 96
  years old, and had remained active in astronomical research well into his
  90’s. He will be remembered for his pioneering scientific work, his superb
  knowledge of astronomical instrumentation, his leadership in bringing the Lick
  3.0m telescope into operation, his courage in the face of difficult
  administrative decisions, his perseverance, and perhaps most of all his
  profound integrity.</p>

  <p>Whitford was born on 22 Oct 1905 in Milton, Wisconsin, the son of Alfred
  and Mary Whitford. He received his undergraduate education at Milton College,
  and earned his PhD at the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 1932. In
  1937, Whitford married Eleanor Bell Whitelaw, and together they raised three
  children, William Curtis, Mary Eleanor and Martha Neill. Mrs. Whitford passed
  away in 1986. Whitford continued to reside in Santa Cruz, carrying on his
  research activities at UC Santa Cruz, before ultimately retiring in Madison,
  Wisconsin in 1996, where he could be closer to members of his immediate
  family.</p>

  <p>In the face of loss, we are grateful to have two public records of
  Whitford’s career, one in his own words: the memoir “A Half Century of
  Astronomy”, Ann Rev Astron Ap, 24, 1, 1986, and a later summary of his life’s
  work, reported by Mike Rich and Don Terndrup, who as graduate students had
  been deeply touched by Whitford’s counsel (“Bulges of Galaxies: A Celebration
  of the 90th Birthday of Albert Whitford”, by R. M. Rich and D. M. Terndrup,
  Pub. Astron. Soc. Pac., 109, 571, 1997). Here the importance of Whitford’s
  research and especially the elements of his personality that I believe made it
  possible will be emphasized.</p>

  <p>As an assistant to the redoubtable Joel Stebbins beginning in 1931,
  Whitford brought his knowledge of experimental laboratory physics into
  astronomy. A PhD physics student at the University of Wisconsin, Whitford had
  had experience measuring tiny electrical currents, similar to those produced
  by the primitive photoelectric cells that Stebbins used in his work at the
  small Washburn observatory refractor. Whitford employed vacuum tube technology
  to greatly amplify the photocell output, and encased the cell itself in a
  vacuum to reduce the noise produced from cosmic ray ionization. Application of
  these new techniques led to a great increase in the sensitivity limit.
  Carrying the new technology west to the 60- and 100-inch telescopes on Mt
  Wilson, Stebbins and Whitford began a long and fruitful collaboration in which
  they measured colors and magnitudes of stars in the North Polar Sequence and
  Selected Areas, as well as globular clusters and galaxies, and investigated
  the interstellar reddening of O and B type stars. In 1937, they introduced the
  so-called six-color photometry, extending magnitude measurements essentially
  from the optical UV cutoff out to 1 micron. In 1948, they pushed out to 2
  microns using the newly invented PbS Cashman cell. Using this device they were
  able to trace the outline of the Galactic nuclear bulge, using the 100-inch
  telescope.</p>

  <p>Of particularly lasting importance, resulting from further trips to Mt
  Wilson after Stebbins’s retirement, was Whitford’s six-color photometric study
  of near and distant OB stars, from which he obtained the “Whitford reddening
  law” (1958). This established the exact amount by which interstellar
  absorption increased with decreasing wavelength. This result provided the
  quantitative tools required to determine the effect, often severe, of
  interstellar dust on the colors and magnitudes of stars, and ultimately had a
  profound impact on the determination of the cosmic distance scale.</p>

  <p>During the period when he agreed to become Director of the Lick Observatory
  and supervise the completion of the 3.0m Shane telescope and its full
  complement of instrumentation, Whitford had little time for personal research.
  But following his de jure retirement in 1973, he embarked on a new kind of
  research project that in effect was a renaissance for him: the study of the
  age and metallicity of the stellar population of the Galactic nuclear bulge.
  In 1978 he showed that the energy distribution of the population in Baade’s
  window was similar to that of the bulges of spirals and elliptical galaxies.
  Later, in collaboration with graduate student Mike Rich whom he mentored, and
  with support from the NSF, Whitford demonstrated that the bulge population was
  predominantly metal-rich, on the basis of spectra obtained with the Las
  Campanas 100-inch telescope. Additional collaboration with Jay Frogel, then
  staff astronomer at CTIO, led to a classical study of the infrared properties
  of the bulge population, particularly the late M-type giants. These studies in
  turn inspired graduate student Don Terndrup, mentored again by Whitford (and
  Sandy Faber), who imaged several bulge fields, and demonstrated, this time
  from color-magnitude arrays, that the population was indeed old, possibly as
  old as the globular cluster population, but nevertheless metal-rich.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the importance of his research, Whitford received two of
  the astronomical community’s highest honors: the Henry Norris Russell
  Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society (1986) and the Catherine
  Wolfe Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1996). In
  addition, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American
  Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served the astronomical community as
  Vice-President (1965-67), then President (1967-70) of the American
  Astronomical Society.</p>

  <p>How Whitford succeeded so admirably in making profound contributions to
  astronomy is all the more remarkable when one considers that he had
  experienced no formal contact with the subject either during his undergraduate
  years at Milton College or his pre-PhD years in the Physics Dept of the
  University of Wisconsin. As he himself noted in the first paragraph of his
  memoir (op cit): “An adult lifetime devoted to astronomical pursuits did not
  in my case evolve naturally out of youthful fascination with the stars. Any
  inclinations that stemmed from boyhood hobbies or early educational influences
  pointed in other directions”. Yet during those early years of collaboration
  with Stebbins, Whitford prepared himself to play a leading role in his new
  profession, particularly after he was appointed assistant professor in the
  Wisconsin Astronomy Department (1938), which meant that formal teaching of
  astronomy was required. He goes on to say (op cit): “Since I had never had any
  classroom instruction in the subject, this had the salutory effect of forcing
  on me a throrough review of the fundamentals of the subject”. This response
  characterizes a seminal feature of Whitford’s personality: perseverance. He
  learned astronomy by private study and teaching, by listening to the important
  figures of the day during visits to Mt Wilson, especially astronomers such as
  Walter Baade, and by doing real astronomy at the telescopes during and after
  his tenure as an NRC Physics Fellow (1933-35). This facet of character may
  well have sprung from his own family heritage of “Yankee stock” and the
  cultural traditions of Milton College, an educational institution with which
  his family had had a long history. But for whatever reason, this habit of
  perseverance lies, I believe, at the root of his post-retirement scientific
  renaissance. Always concerned with the colors and magnitudes of Galaxy bulges,
  Whitford took his interest a step further and learned all he could as
  background to his own study of the stars in the bulge of our own Galaxy, by
  reading and listening. Some who come into astronomy from the “outside”
  continue to practice their technical specialty, but do not “learn” astronomy
  from a broad perspective. Whitford was not among these: his way was the way of
  total immersion.</p>

  <p>A further aspect of Whitford’s character is found in his willing acceptance
  of serious responsibilities. Interrupting a budding astronomical career in
  1940, he joined the MIT defense project in which microwave radar and its
  military applications were developed and which culminated in radar capable of
  detecting German U-boats then threatening shipping in the Atlantic. From 1948
  onward, he chaired the UW Dept of Astronomy succeeding Stebbins as Director of
  the Washburn Observatory. He guided the planning and construction of the Pine
  Bluff observing station that was dedicated in 1958, shortly before he left to
  become Director of the Lick Observatory. In his leadership of Lick, he was
  brilliantly successful in bringing the 3.0m reflector, then the second largest
  telescope in the world, to completion. Serious problems had developed both in
  the telescope drive and the figure of the primary mirror. Whitford devoted his
  own personal talent to the solution of the problems and made the necessary, if
  contentious, changes in engineering personnel that were required. He further
  supervised, or supported others, in providing the then state-of-the-art
  instruments needed if the potential of the telescope was to be realized. In
  1966, he supervised the complex move of the Lick scientific staff from Mt
  Hamilton to UC Santa Cruz, along with the shops and technical and
  administrative support personnel. Although initially a wrenching experience
  for a staff that had long identified itself with a mountaintop way of life,
  most soon recognized that campus life provided new research opportunities not
  available in a remote site. Whitford promoted a successful effort, with
  support from the NSF, to bring a cadre of theoretical astrophysicists to join
  the Lick astronomers in Santa Cruz, thus forming a new and more broadly based
  graduate program. The preservation and later expansion of the Lick shops
  provided a venue in which modern engineering personnel could be attracted, who
  in turn were responsible for advances in digital detector technology and
  modern complex optical fabrication. In later years, these shops became the
  nucleus of laboratory support for instrumentation at the Keck telescopes.</p>

  <p>In 1962, Whitford served the entire astronomical community by chairing the
  first survey of astronomy under the auspices of the NAS. This led in 1964 to
  what became known as “The Whitford Report”, a plan for the public and private
  support of astronomy during the subsequent decade, and which had as its
  centerpiece the construction of what later became the 4.0m telescopes at Kitt
  Peak and Cerro Tololo. The Whitford Report became the model for later decadal
  planning documents. At the time, the Report was deemed quite “visionary”, but
  as Whitford later noted, somewhat wryly, “most of the recommendations...were
  finally implemented, but not in the originally projected 10-year period. In
  retrospect, these recommendations now seem rather modest.” (op cit.)</p>

  <p>I did not know Whitford at all before 1967, when I joined the staff after
  the move from Mt Hamilton to Santa Cruz. My knowledge of his tenure on Mt
  Hamilton is therefore limited to what I have learned from others who lived and
  worked on Mt Hamilton at the time. A summary of those impressions, which seems
  consistent with my own post-1967 observations, is the following: Albert
  Whitford was kind, unswervingly loyal to the Observatory, scientifically and
  technically knowledgeable, scrupulously honest and fair, enormously respectful
  of scientific accomplishment, strongly supportive of staff who were doing good
  work. Personally, he was tireless, working in his office late at night,
  dealing with the necessary drudgery of administering Observatory affairs,
  honest and forthright, deeply concerned about being fair and democratic. I
  would add to this that Whitford was a man of reserved personality, quiet and
  introspective. He was not a “political animal”, and certainly not a
  “glad-hander” experienced in the nuances of University politics. The
  controversy that arose within the University of California concerning the
  governance of the resource represented by the newly-completed 3.0m telescope
  could not have been a challenge easily welcomed or managed by a man of
  Whitford’s personality. Nevertheless, he succeeded admirably in fulfilling the
  wish of the staff to re-establish the academic and technical affairs of Lick
  on the newly opened UC Santa Cruz campus, where the Observatory was welcomed
  with great enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Whitford enjoyed hiking in the Sierra even into advanced years. Mike Rich
  recalled his hardiness when, during one of their observing trips to Chile,
  Whitford tackled climbing a hill behind the Tololo compound, and went on hikes
  in the Elqui Valley, all this in his advanced years. Whitford especially liked
  travel to distant places. In the course of his life, he succeeded in setting
  foot on every continent. He took special pride in adding Antarctica to the
  list when in his 80’s he stepped from a dinghy to the Antarctic shore, having
  boarded a cruise ship at Chile’s Puerto Montt. He was also a fan of the San
  Francisco Opera. We went together on one occasion and I recall his being
  bowled over by Gwyneth Jones’s portrayal of Isolde in Wagner’s opera. Could
  this lie behind one of Whitford’s especially trenchant bon mot’s? When
  lamenting a bout with a staff member, he was heard to say “I can put up with a
  prima donna, (long pause ....) IF she can sing!”</p>

  <p>I am reminded too that, despite his generally quiet and thoughtful
  demeanor, Whitford was a very sociable dinner guest whose engaging remarks
  revealed his deep interest in national and international politics, in addition
  to astronomy. On other occasions, long and somewhat awkward pauses were a
  characteristic facet of his conversation. It was as if Whitford were searching
  for words of exactly the right weight, color and judiciousness before making
  any further commitment on a given subject. It was entirely in character.</p>

  <p>Of the several UCSC students who were mentored or advised by Whitford, and
  this includes Nick Suntzeff, Mike Rich, Don Terndrup, and Dave Burstein, all
  have spoken of his willingness to serve as a sounding board for their ideas as
  they struggled with the task of learning to do research astronomy. One spoke
  of Whitford’s advice to take refereeing seriously, another his admonition to
  limit one’s objectives in any given research paper and eschew diffuseness. Yet
  another recalled his surprise when he first observed Whitford in the course of
  a colloquium. “Whitford would sit in the back of the room...with his eyes
  closed and one would think him asleep. Except, when the colloquium ended, he
  was usually the first with the most penetrating question possible!”</p>

  <p>Albert Whitford was not a man given to garrulousness and did not wear his
  heart on his sleeve. But one could get to know him a bit more intimately with
  the slow passage of time. We were deeply impressed by his sharply informed
  knowledge of the research literature and his continued contributions to it
  almost to his 90th year. His sense of personal loyalty to Lick was deeply
  intertwined with his own research. Occasionally a visitor or even a staff
  member might express surprise, in Whitford’s company, that a man in his 80’s
  would make the daily sojourn to his UCSC office to do research, talk to
  students and faculty, and listen to the colloquia. To this comment, I recall
  that Whitford had an especially poignant response: ”But this is my home; this
  is where my family is.”</p>
