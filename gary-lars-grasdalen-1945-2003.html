  <p>With the passing of Gary Grasdalen on 30 April 2003 the astronomical
  community has lost one its most creative members. Born in Albert Lea,
  Minnesota on 7 October 1945 to the farming family of Lars G. and Lillie
  Grasdalen, Gary developed a strong childhood interest in science, and a
  particular fascination with astronomy. In 1964, he entered Harvard College
  intending to pursue those interests. During his freshman year, Gary enrolled
  in an undergraduate research seminar in which he first displayed the
  combination of keen insight and imagination in applying new techniques that
  was manifest throughout his professional career. In 1968, he published his
  first two papers---studies of the C<sup><font size="2">
        12</font>
    </sup> /C<sup><font size="2">
        13</font>
    </sup> ratio in metal deficient stars, and of Fe I and Fe II transition
    probabilities---which summarized research carried out during his junior and
    senior years at Harvard. Grasdalen next entered the astronomy graduate
    program at the University of California, Berkeley. There he developed a
    strong interest in the early stages of stellar evolution and, in particular,
    the potential of S-1 image intensifiers and newly available near-infrared
    detectors to detect and analyze the stellar populations embedded within
    their parent molecular cloud complexes.</p>
  <p>Following award of his PhD in 1972, Grasdalen was appointed to the staff at
  the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Early in his career at KPNO, Gary
  developed tools that enabled routine near-infrared mapping of nearby molecular
  cloud complexes, most notably the telescope control programs that enabled
  precise raster scanning of these regions. Those same programs were some of the
  many innovations in which Gary had a hand. These innovations enabled a
  generation of KPNO observers in the 1970s to fully exploit the power of the
  newly commissioned Mayall telescope as well as the smaller telescopes on Kitt
  Peak.</p>

  <p>In 1973, he published the first map of the central region of a molecular
  cloud, which revealed an extensive embedded, optically obscured population of
  newly formed stars in the Ophiuchus complex. This discovery led to a series of
  survey papers cataloging and describing the young stellar population
  associated with multiple nearby clouds. The results from these early survey
  papers produced finding lists and nomenclature for embedded young stars that
  are still referenced by researchers.</p>

  <p>By developing the tools needed to point telescopes precisely, Grasdalen was
  able to follow a hunch that he had while a graduate student at Berkeley---that
  Herbig-Haro objects were excited by optically obscured young stars that were
  displaced from these emission nebulae. He believed these objects to be
  reflection nebulae, scattering light earthward from a young star whose
  powerful wind had carved out a cavity thus creating an indirect pathway for
  optical photons to reach observers from an otherwise invisible star. Grasdalen
  compiled a list of candidate H-H objects from the Palomar Observatory Sky
  Survey and began a near-infrared search for associated young stars, first
  using inefficient PbS and when they became available, InSb detectors. In 1974,
  his insight was rewarded with the discovery of the embedded young star
  associated with H-H 100 in Corona Austrina, and soon thereafter, with multiple
  candidate infrared sources associated with H-H objects. The 1974 discovery
  paper notes that the exciting source for H-H 100 is located near the geometric
  center of a 0.1 pc, roughly spherical cloud, providing early evidence that
  young stars form within regions that we now call ``molecular cores". Following
  several years of study, it became clear that the H-H objects themselves are in
  fact directly excited via stellar wind-molecular cloud interactions, thus
  invalidating the hypothesis that H-H objects are pure reflection nebulae.
  Nevertheless, Grasdalen's pioneering discovery of infrared sources associated
  with these objects, combined with the infrared survey results, led to a
  veritable explosion of infrared and molecular line studies of star-forming
  regions.</p>

  <p>Grasdalen was also a major contributor to early attempts to understand the
  nature of intermediate mass young stars - the Herbig Ae/Be stars. His work
  demonstrated both their pre-main sequence nature via surface gravity
  measurements and that these objects share infrared properties in common with
  their lower mass counterparts.</p>

  <p>Results from these studies were summarized in a review published in "Annual
  Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics" in 1975. This was an early attempt to
  provide a comprehensive overview of star-formation in molecular cloud
  complexes and to link the emerging results from mm-wave and infrared
  observations. Perhaps as noteworthy as the overview was his introduction of
  the term ``Young Stellar Object" or YSO. In part, this term was invented by
  Grasdalen as a reaction to the term ``QSO", which in those days (and indeed
  today) seemed to create an aura of mystery, seductive both to the public and
  the astronomical community; we star-formation types hoped that YSO would do
  the same for our field!</p>

  <p>In 1978, Grasdalen left Kitt Peak for the University of Wyoming where,
  along with Bob Gehrz and John Hackwell, he made the Mt. Jelm 2.1-meter
  telescope a world-leading facility for infrared studies. His research
  interests evolved to include, in addition to YSO research, infrared
  spectroscopic study of novae, a field that he, Gehrz and Hackwell pioneered
  and which Bob Gehrz has carried forward, creating an impressive and important
  oeuvre. Grasdalen was a mentor to a generation of graduates from the
  University of Wyoming including Kathleen deGioia-Eastwood, Matthew Greenhouse,
  Karl Klett, Gregory Sloan, Jill Price, Michael Castelaz, Craig Gullixson and
  Thomas Hayward. To a person, they spoke to the high standards he set, his
  constant expectation of excellence and critical thinking, the amazing range
  and depth of his knowledge, and his incredibly creative mind.</p>

  <p>Following important and influential service on the Optical-Infrared panel
  for the 1990 decadal survey, Gary left the University of Wyoming and, for
  awhile (and much to our collective loss), astronomy. Gary was a very private
  and, in many ways, a wary person. His decision may have been linked to a need
  for a break from a lifetime of pressure. In the early 1980s, Gary acknowledged
  that he was gay, a fact which for years he carefully hid from his friends and
  colleagues. While he found much support at the University of Wyoming (and
  elsewhere), both subtle and rampant homophobia had to have an affect on
  someone who was both unusually sensitive and filled with self-doubt. With
  increasing frequency, whatever Gary may have felt deep within led to bouts of
  self-destructive behavior. At least it seemed that way to his friends and
  colleagues; to him, it may have been release. A sad consequence was his
  contracting AIDS.</p>

  <p>During the 1990s, Gary ran a non-alcoholic bar in Denver, and according to
  some, was at relative peace. Apparently, his love for astronomy was still
  deeply felt and he ultimately returned to work during his last years at the
  Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain Observatory. There, he once again
  brought his expertise in telescope control systems to bear to upgrade the
  observatory and enable tracking of rapidly moving objects. He continued to
  work at Table Mountain until a few weeks before passing away from
  complications associated with AIDS.</p>

  <p>We will miss his acid, sometimes black humor, his enjoyment of a
  stimulating argument, his seemingly off-the-wall, but always, in retrospect
  incredibly insightful comments. He accomplished much and, perhaps had he found
  peace and acceptance earlier, could have accomplished so much more.</p>

  <p>His two sisters, Lavon Engen of Naples, Florida and Janet Stallerin of
  Albert Lean, Minnesota, survive Gary.</p>
