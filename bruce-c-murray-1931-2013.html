        <p>Bruce Churchill Murray, Caltech Professor of Planetary Science,
        Emeritus, and former head of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),
        succumbed to complications of Alzheimer's disease on August 29, 2013. He
        was 81.</p>

        <p>A founder of planetary science, Murray transformed our understanding
        of the solar system by applying his geologic training to the study of
        other worlds. He played a key role in equipping JPL's first Mars
        missions with cameras, an idea often dismissed at the time as a public
        relations gimmick; and as JPL's director during the Carter and Reagan
        administrations, he rescued the Galileo mission to Jupiter and Voyager
        2's flybys of Uranus and Neptune from the budget ax.</p>

        <p>Murray was born on November 30, 1931, in New York City. His parents
        moved to California soon after, and he graduated from Santa Monica High
        in 1949. Upon being refused admission to Caltech—"I got a D in physics
        my senior year," he explained in his oral history—he enrolled at MIT,
        emerging in 1955 with a PhD in geology. He married his first wife, Joan
        O'Brien, in 1954.</p>

        <p>After graduating, Murray logged offshore drilling cores for the
        Standard Oil Company until 1958, when he entered the Air Force to
        fulfill his ROTC commitment. Assigned to Hanscom Field in Bedford,
        Massachusetts, Murray helped make the high-precision calculations of the
        geoid—Earth's gravitational field—needed to aim our ballistic missiles
        accurately.</p>

        <p>When Murray's hitch ended in 1960, Caltech geochemist Harrison Brown
        hired him as a research fellow to study meteorites. Murray's interests
        were broader; in 1961, he, Kenneth Watson (MS '59, PhD '64), and Brown
        showed that significant water might remain on the dust-dry moon,
        preserved in the permanently shadowed areas near the poles—a prediction
        not confirmed until 2009. "It was a revolutionary idea," says David
        Stevenson, Caltech's Marvin J. Goldberger Professor of Planetary
        Science. "Bruce was the first person to think about the role of ice in
        the solar system, which is now absolutely fundamental to our
        understanding of, for example, the moons of Jupiter and Saturn."</p>

        <p>A casual conversation would set the course of Murray's career. Soon
        after arriving on campus, he flew out to Dallas to give his final paper
        on the geoid. His seatmate led the "special projects" branch out at
        China Lake, a rocket lab that Caltech and the Navy had set up during
        World War II, and the special project was a top-secret, highly sensitive
        infrared detector for the heat-seeking Sidewinder missile. (Infrared
        light has longer wavelengths than visible light and is emitted by all
        warm objects.) Murray mentioned a desire to make infrared observations
        of the moon, "and he said, 'Why don't you come up and see us sometime?'
        I still had [my security] clearance . . . so I did."</p>

        <p>Murray took master instrument builder Jim Westphal (then a senior
        engineer in geology; later a professor of planetary science) with him.
        Westphal had no security clearance, so they couldn't discuss the
        detector in any way. Instead, the Caltech duo specified the hardware and
        electronics needed to mate a detector to a telescope, and the missile
        men used those specs to build a "black box" containing the detector—on
        the condition, of course, that the box remained unopened.</p>

        <p>The box blew the socks off civilian technology, and in December 1962,
        Murray, Westphal, and postdoc Robert Wildey (BS '57, MS '58, PhD '62)
        mounted it on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory to look
        at Venus while JPL's Mariner 2 made the first-ever flyby of another
        planet. Venus's cloud-covered face is a blank disk, and the spacecraft
        carried no camera. Instead, an infrared radiometer would construct a
        temperature profile of the Venusian atmosphere by scanning
        perpendicularly across the planet's edge. The plan was simply to check
        the radiometer data; however, the Hale is designed to peer into deepest
        space, and Venus is so close that a tiny patch of its surface filled the
        field of view. Unsure of the radiometer's exact aim, Murray and company
        methodically scanned the entire planet, recording their readings on a
        roll of chart paper. Discovering that the scans weren't uniform, they
        cut them up and laid them side by side across a circle drawn to
        represent Venus. The resulting temperature map had two cold spots on
        opposite edges of the circle—Venus's north and south poles—revealing the
        planet's rotational axis for the first time.</p>

        <p>JPL's Mariner 4 did carry a camera on the first-ever flyby of Mars in
        July 1965. Caltech astronomer Robert Leighton (BS '41, MS '44, PhD '47)
        led the so-called television experiment team, which included Robert
        Sharp (BS '34, MS '35), chair of the geology division and an expert on
        landforms, and Murray, by now Caltech's first associate professor of
        planetary science. Creating a single image takes an awful lot of pixels,
        and the camera had to share downlink time with the "real" data—the
        numbers being returned by the other six instruments. The engineers
        wanted to minimize the transmission load by encoding the images at 3
        bits per pixel, or eight shades of gray. Murray insisted on 8 bits (256
        shades)—not exactly high-def, but enough to show geologically
        interesting details. The resulting pictures of a heavily cratered
        moonscape destroyed the notion of Mars as a habitable, Earthlike
        world.</p>

        <p>Murray and Leighton then used Mariner's atmospheric data to calculate
        the regional heat exchange between the surface of Mars and its
        atmosphere. They found that the poles got cold enough each winter to
        freeze the carbon-dioxide atmosphere into seasonal caps of dry ice,
        another revolutionary idea that has since proven true—Mars's atmospheric
        density varies by some 25 percent over the course of its year.</p>

        <p>Murray continued exploring Mars as a TV team member on the Mariner 6
        and 7 flybys of 1969 and on Mariner 9, which in 1971 became the first
        spacecraft to orbit another planet, photographing the entire globe in
        fine detail—eventually, that is. This Mariner arrived at Mars during the
        thickest dust storm ever seen, as Murray recounted in his oral history.
        In the weeks that followed, "there was a gradual clearing, like a stage
        scene, and three dark spots showed up." As the dust continued to settle,
        the spots developed into huge craters and slowly became the summits of
        volcanoes—each one some 10 miles tall and as wide as the state of
        Missouri. Other photos revealed a rift system, the Valles Marineris,
        long enough to stretch from San Francisco to Baltimore.</p>

        <p>Murray revisited the inner solar system in 1974 as the TV team leader
        for Mariner 10, which flew by Venus and hitherto unexplored Mercury. By
        then, JPL could make "color" images by compositing pictures taken
        through various filters mounted on a wheel in front of the camera.
        Recent ultraviolet observations of Venus from Earth had found a faint,
        fast-moving feature resembling a sideways 'Y' that seemed to circle the
        planet every four days, so Murray persuaded JPL to add an ultraviolet
        segment to Mariner 10's filter wheel. These ultraviolet images—thousands
        of them—documented an exquisitely complex collection of markings that
        traced the circulation patterns in Venus's upper atmosphere.</p>

        <p>From April 1, 1976 to June 30, 1982, Murray served as director of
        JPL—a tenure that balanced the highs of the Viking landings on Mars and
        the Voyagers' flights by Jupiter and Saturn against the constant battles
        with Washington to keep the Lab afloat. "He was like Lyndon Johnson. He
        pushed people hard, and he expressed his opinions forcefully," says
        Professor of Planetary Science Andrew Ingersoll, the "weatherman" on the
        Voyagers' atmospheric-science team. "But he never held a grudge; after a
        disagreement he would just forge ahead. And that's the key: he did
        forge."</p>

        <p>Murray mobilized public support for JPL by cofounding The Planetary
        Society with Carl Sagan and Louis Friedman in 1980, serving variously as
        vice president, president, and chairman. "Nowadays, NASA expects every
        mission to do public outreach. They set aside money for it in the
        budget, and you have to do it," says David Stevenson. "Back then, it was
        not required, but Bruce felt very strongly that it was the right thing
        to do."</p>

        <p>"Bruce was really dedicated to exploring the frontiers," concurs Ed
        Stone, the David Morrisroe Professor of Physics, director of JPL from
        1991 to 2001 and Voyager's project scientist. "He recognized the power
        of scientific imaging, and the opportunity it provided to engage the
        public."</p>

        <p>Murray was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences
        and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a
        member of the American Astronomical Society and the American Geophysical
        Union. One of his books, Journey Into Space, won two awards for science
        writing. His other honors include NASA's Exceptional Scientific
        Achievement Medal, NASA's Distinguished Public Service Medal, and two
        NASA Distinguished Service Medals.</p>

        <p>He is survived by Suzanne, his wife of 41 years; five children; and
        10 grandchildren.</p>

        <p>A public memorial service will be held at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday,
        November 10, at the Caltech Athenaeum.</p>
