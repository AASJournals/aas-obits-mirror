      <h1>Leon William Schroeder (1921-1995)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Leon W. Schroeder, for many years <em>the</em> astronomer at Oklahoma State
  University, was born 25 January 1921 in Guthrie, OK and graduated from
  Stillwater High School in 1937. His college work at Oklahoma A&amp;M College
  was interrupted by flight training and, eventually, teaching at the No. 3
  British Flying Training School in Miami, OK. He retained his pilot's license
  and frequently provided transportation for members and visitors of the
  Oklahoma State physics department.</p>

  <p>Schroeder returned to Oklahoma A&amp;M after the war, receiving a BS in
  engineering physics in 1947 and an MS in physics in 1948, with a thesis on
  hyperfine splitting in the spectrum of sodium. He moved smoothly from student
  to instructor to assistant professor of physics there, but took a leave of
  absence to pursue graduate work at Indiana University in 1954-56 (joining the
  AAS in 1955), where he received a PhD in astrophysics in 1958, with a
  dissertation on the line spectrum of Arcturus, under the direction of Marshal
  Wrubel. His promotion to associate professor in 1958 coincided roughly with
  the institutional name change from Oklahoma A&amp;M to Oklahoma State.</p>

  <p>Schroeder acquired primary responsibility for the teaching of astronomy at
  OSU in 1968, at the retirement of H.S. Mendenhall (still an AAS member) and
  rapidly increased the enrollment in introductory courses to about 500 per
  semester, in what became the most popular general studies course on campus. He
  was promoted to full professor in 1969 and retired in 1984. In addition to
  regular teaching responsibilities, Schroeder organized observing sessions for
  students and the public and participated in a number of teaching workshops,
  summer sessions, and development of self-paced and correspondence versions of
  courses. The picture was taken while he was introducing visitors to the OSU
  14" telescope; predictably, the others were not wearing suits and ties. The
  intersection of Schroeder's astrophysical and aeronautical interests led to
  participation in a variety of NASA educational activities, and he was an
  observer at several Apollo launches and a participant in the ceremonies
  surrounding the first Mars landing.</p>

  <p>His own research interests remained firmly in the general area of stellar
  spectroscopy, with data gathered during leaves at Dominion Astrophysical
  Observatory, Dyer Observatory, and Kitt Peak, and analyzed in collaboration
  with a number of graduate students. Ten people completed PhD degrees under his
  direction and an additional nine wrote masters' theses, including Hugh Peebles
  (now of Lamar University) and Thomas Jordan (now of Ball State).</p>

  <p>Of German ancestry, Schroeder was a life-long Lutheran as well as Sooner
  and a supporter of Camp Lutherhoma as well as of the OSU football and
  basketball teams. He died peacefully, in his sleep on 1 March 1995 and is
  survived by his wife, the former Geraldine Longan, a son Terry Schroeder, a
  daughter Cynthia Schroeder McDonald, and a number of grandchildren and
  great-grandchildren.</p>
