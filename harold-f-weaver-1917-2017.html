  <p>Harold F. Weaver, emeritus professor of astronomy and founder of the Radio
  Astronomy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, died at his
  home in Kensington, California, on April 26, 2017. He was 99.</p>

  <p>Harold was born on September 25, 1917, in San Jose, California, and studied
  astronomy at UC Berkeley through completion of a bachelor’s degree in 1940 and
  Ph.D. in 1942. As an undergraduate Harold met and married fellow astronomy
  student Cecile Trumpler, whose father, astronomer Robert Trumpler,
  subsequently served as Harold’s doctoral advisor. As a graduate student Harold
  spent three summers at Mt. Wilson Observatory, working in close association
  with Walter Baade. Harold held a National Research Council Fellowship at
  Yerkes Observatory during 1942-1943 before transitioning to war work,
  initially with the National Defense Research Committee at the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology, and subsequently at the UC Berkeley Radiation
  Laboratory. He joined UC’s Lick Observatory as a staff member in 1945 and
  moved to a faculty position at Berkeley in 1951. Harold was instrumental in
  establishing the Radio Astronomy Laboratory and served as its founding
  director from 1958 to 1972. He also served as chair of the Department of
  Astronomy during the 1979-80 academic year. Harold retired in 1988, but
  subsequently remained very engaged in the life of the department, and came in
  every day until he was well into his nineties.</p>

  <p>Harold contributed in a significant way to the emergence of the Berkeley
  department as an international hub of multiwavelength innovation and discovery
  in astronomy. His research focused on Milky Way structure and the interstellar
  medium, and he was an expert on statistical methods for determining
  three-dimensional distributions of stars and their properties. He was known as
  a committed teacher and mentor, who cared about his students. Harold was also
  an institutional leader, serving in several major roles that shaped the
  Berkeley campus and its activities, and as an officer with national
  professional organizations.</p>

  <p>As a student Harold became interested in using statistical methods to
  recover the three-dimensional distribution of stars in Milky Way fields, with
  allowance for extinction effects on optical data. Trumpler had previously
  carried out a classic study using the statistics of star cluster sizes to
  demonstrate the existence of a distributed absorbing medium in the plane of
  the Milky Way. Building on these efforts, the two later authored the text
  <i>Statistical Astronomy</i> (University of California Press, 1953), which
  remains an authoritative reference on analysis of optical data to recover
  stellar distribution functions relevant for studies of Galactic structure,
  interstellar extinction, and stellar populations.</p>

  <p>The emergence of radio astronomy and its potential for the study of
  Galactic structure attracted Harold’s attention as a young faculty member. He
  successfully advocated for university investment in a radio observatory, and
  as its first director, led planning for the new facility and secured funding
  from the Office of Naval Research. In carrying out site selection, Harold and
  his team factored in protection from line-of-sight radio interference, as well
  as terrain, enabling future expansion to include an interferometric array. The
  result was Hat Creek Observatory in northern California, with Harold
  personally leading lease negotiations for the property and many of the design
  decisions.</p>

  <p>The new observatory was equipped with a 33-foot dish, used primarily for
  engineering and testing, and an 85-foot telescope, which quickly became the
  workhorse for cm-wavelength observations. Under Harold’s direction, studies
  were conducted using measurements of interstellar hydrogen and later hydroxyl
  (OH). A breakthrough occurred in 1965 with the discovery by Harold’s team of
  the first astrophysical maser. The remarkable properties of the detected lines
  – including very high brightness temperature, sharp features, variability, and
  polarization – led to an initial attribution of the emission to “mysterium”
  prior to its interpretation by other groups as maser amplification of OH.</p>

  <p>The 85-foot telescope was used to carry out numerous studies of Galactic
  hydrogen using the 21 cm. line, including two large angular-scale surveys. The
  resulting data form a rich basis for probing Galactic structure as well as the
  morphology and physics of the interstellar medium. The depth of detail evident
  in these data and other 21-cm surveys remained a source of fascination and
  inspiration for Harold through the remainder of his career, leading him to
  invest considerable effort in experimenting with novel visualization and
  analysis methods. The results led to many stimulating conversations with
  colleagues and other researchers in the field. Hat Creek as a facility has
  remained a crucial proving ground for other innovations in radio astronomy,
  notably in advancing technology for mm-wavelength observations and
  interferometry, and in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
  (SETI).</p>

  <p>As a faculty member Harold was known as a gifted teacher and an outstanding
  research mentor. He took an active interest in the professional success of
  students and younger colleagues. Upon Robert Trumpler’s passing, Harold helped
  create a memorial in the form of the Trumpler Award, conferred annually by the
  Astronomical Society of the Pacific to recognize outstanding dissertation
  research in astronomy, which he saw as a means to honor his own mentor while
  helping launch promising young scientists in their careers. Harold was also
  committed to fostering the public’s knowledge of science, giving frequent
  talks to amateur astronomy and school groups. In his retirement he joined the
  board of directors for the Chabot Observatory and Science Center and assisted
  in a major transformation and expansion of that facility, resulting in the
  Chabot Space &amp; Science Center which serves as a nexus of informal science
  education in the San Francisco Bay area.</p>

  <p>Harold was known throughout his career for his sound judgment and clear
  insight in academic and professional matters. At Berkeley, his leadership made
  a lasting imprint on the university campus, through service on the Committee
  on Buildings and Campus Development during a crucial phase of new construction
  in the 1950s. One outcome was the construction of a new building, Campbell
  Hall, named for astronomer and University of California President William W.
  Campbell, which provided a congenial home for the Department of Astronomy for
  over 50 years. Harold provided major service over 14 years as a member of the
  Scientific and Academic Advisory Committee for the Livermore and Los Alamos
  national laboratories, chairing that body from 1981 to 1986, and reporting on
  its findings to the University of California president and Board of Regents.
  As one recognition of his research excellence and lasting service to the
  Berkeley campus, he was awarded the Berkeley Citation in 1988.</p>

  <p>At the national level Harold was a leader of organizations committed to
  advancing research and education in astronomy. Serving on the Board of
  Directors for the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) from 1968 to 1971,
  and as president of that organization from 1971 to 1973, he was instrumental
  in making changes that greatly expanded the ASP’s reach and scope of
  activities. He was a member of the ASP’s Finance Committee for three decades
  and served as its chair from 1972 to 1990, providing guidance in restructuring
  its investment policy that enabled the ASP to acquire its first building (in a
  purchase negotiated by Harold) as a permanent headquarters in 1989.</p>

  <p>Harold’s talents were also tapped by the American Astronomical Society
  (AAS). He was a councilor from 1954 to 1957, and held the office of acting
  treasurer or treasurer from 1977 to 1987. In the latter role he did a great
  deal to transition the society’s fiscal management to a professional standard
  and to improve its financial position. During this period he was also
  instrumental in helping the AAS move to a sustainable model for supporting its
  journals, and was prescient in his advocacy for innovation in publishing.</p>

  <p>In addition to his wife, Cecile, Harold is survived by his three children:
  Margot Garcia of Tucson, Arizona; Paul Weaver of Kensington; and Kirk Weaver
  of Houston, Texas; as well as six grandchildren and 11
  great-grandchildren.</p>
