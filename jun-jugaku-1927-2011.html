  <p>An expert on stellar physics, the president of IAU commission on stellar
  spectra (1982-85) and an associate editor of the Publications of Astronomical
  Society of Japan (PASJ) for 24 years who made it to be one of the top-level
  journals of astronomy.</p>

  <p>Jun Jugaku was born on 19 September 1927 in a famous family in Kyoto to
  Bunsho and Shizu. He had an elder sister, all of them belonging to an
  intellectual society by publishing books on English and Japanese literature as
  well as on astronomy. He had been educated in Kyoto and graduated from Kyoto
  University by majoring in astronomy in March 1950.</p>

  <p>In 1953, with a Fulbright fellowship in the USA, he was successfully
  accepted as a graduate student by the University of Michigan. There his
  advisor was Lawrence H. Aller, with whom he studied stellar atmospheres, and
  published papers on the spectra of Tau Scorpii as well as on B-type stars in
  general. In 1957, he completed the course and the Ph.D. degree was awarded in
  1958. His Ph.D. thesis was “A Study of the Ratio of Helium to Hydrogen in the
  Atmospheres of the B Stars.”</p>

  <p>He came back to Kyoto University by obtaining a fellowship to commemorate
  Hideki Yukawa, who had been awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949. There he worked
  with Chushiro Hayashi and published papers on “Evolutions of Massive Stars,”
  “Models of Massive Stars in Helium- Burning Stage,” and others.</p>

  <p>In 1958 he was nominated as a research associate of the California
  Institute of Technology and worked with Wallace L. W. Sargent and others on
  stellar physics. There he detected 3He in the atmosphere of 3 Centauri and
  with Roger Cayrel he studied the atmospheres of late-type stars.</p>

  <p>In 1963 he was appointed as Lecturer of Tokyo Astronomical Observatory,
  University of Tokyo, and in the next year promoted to Associate Professor. One
  of his important works there was the optical identification of the radio star,
  Sco X-1, for which Minoru Oda determined a rough position using his Sudare
  collimator. To use the 188-cm telescope at Okayama Observing Station, he
  suggested an idea to Oda and they succeeded in identifying Sco X-1.</p>

  <p>While he was at Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, he spent much time in the
  editorial work of the Publication of the Astronomical Society of Japan (PASJ).
  Before the 1980s, as the financial situation of the Astronomical Society had
  been very poor, no staff-assisted editorial work was employed. Therefore,
  associate editors had to cover all the editorial work of PASJ. He came in as
  an associate editor; after he learned what editorial staff should do, he made
  every effort to improve the quality of PASJ by the standpoint of editors.</p>

  <p>Shortly before he became the associate editor, the referee system was
  introduced for PASJ. However, in the early days, referees were chosen only
  among Japanese astronomers. Then he introduced the system that at least one of
  the two referees for each paper was chosen from among the international
  community and the level of the refereeing system became of an international
  standard. He served as the associate editor for 24 years, in 1963-67 and again
  in 1969-89. Indeed, his efforts pushed the scientific level of PASJ much
  higher than before.</p>

  <p>He had been involved in activities of the International Astronomical Union
  (IAU). In 1979-85, he served as the Vice-President and then President of the
  Commission 29 on Stellar Spectra and as a member of the organizing committee
  of the Bio-astronomy commission in 1982-91. He was an editor of the
  proceedings of IAU Symposium on ”Star Forming Regions.”</p>

  <p>He had been a rationalist as well as a humanist in whole his life. And as
  he had been concerned with paranormal theory spreading in Japan、 with his
  colleagues the Japan Skeptics Society was organized and the first issue of its
  journal was published 20 years ago. He served as the first President of the
  Japan Skeptics.</p>

  <p>In 1970s Japanese astronomers started to discuss about a plan for a new
  optical telescope, for which he had a definite idea. In fact he proposed to
  install the new telescope at an astronomically good place, namely a place such
  as at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Although his idea was not supported so much at the
  beginning, the new 8-m telescope, Subaru, was completed at Mauna Kea at the
  end of 20th century.</p>

  <p>At the age of 60 he left the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory as well as
  Tokyo University as a professor in 1988, and for the next 10 years he worked
  for Tokai University.</p>

  <p>Although he suffered from a brain stroke in 2003 and from a blockage of the
  small intestine in 2006, he almost completely recovered. Still, in the last
  five years he had to stay in bed for most of the time. However, his brain had
  been kept very clear and he read many scientific papers which he could
  understand well. However, after he felt that books were too heavy for him to
  hold, he passed away on 14 September 2011. In fact he had been a hard worker
  in every sense and as his only hobby he spent his free time for bird watching
  with his wife and friends.</p>

  <p>His wife, Kazuko, survives him.</p>
