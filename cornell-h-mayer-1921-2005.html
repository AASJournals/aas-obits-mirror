  <p>Cornell (Connie) H. Mayer, a pioneer of radio astronomy, died on 19
  November 2005 of congestive heart failure at his home in Mt. Vernon, Virginia.
  He was eighty-three.</p>

  <p>Cornell Mayer was born in Ossian, Iowa on 10 December 1921. After
  graduating from the University of Iowa in 1943, he joined the Navy during
  World War II and was stationed at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in
  Washington, DC. There he assisted Fred T. Haddock in the development of the
  first radar antenna inside a submarine periscope. This device has been
  credited with shortening the war in the Pacific because of the number of
  Japanese ships that were sunk with its aid. With Haddock, Connie also
  discovered centimeter-wave radio bursts from the sun coincident with solar
  flares. They made the first detection of thermal radio emission from the Orion
  nebula and other galactic HII regions. They also detected extragalactic
  objects and thus initiated the important field of centimeter-wave astronomy.
  Their observations were made with a 50-foot parabolic reflector on a gun mount
  located on the roof of one of the NRL buildings. This telescope had the
  world's highest radio resolving power for many years.</p>

  <p>With Haddock's departure to the University of Michigan in 1956 to create a
  new radio observatory there, Connie became head of a group in the Radio
  Astronomy Branch at NRL, where he remained until his retirement in 1980. Much
  of his work involved the measurement of planetary temperatures by analysis of
  radio emissions. By making technical innovations in instrumentation--such as
  replacing disc choppers with a ferrite switch to compare the sky and reference
  load, or using argon gas tubes for calibration--Connie greatly improved the
  performance of his equipment. This resulted in the discovery of an
  astonishing, 600oC surface temperature of Venus, which contradicted the
  widespread notion that Venus was similar to the Earth and potentially
  habitable. In spite of the extraordinarily careful and systematic way that the
  observations were carried out and analyzed, many remained skeptical about the
  result and its interpretation in terms of a massive greenhouse effect, until
  the Mariner-II spacecraft fly-by in 1962, which put all such doubts to rest.
  Connie and his group continued to make radio observations of other planets and
  discovered a non-thermal centimeter wavelength emission from Jupiter. This led
  directly to work done at Caltech that demonstrated the existence of Van
  Allen-like belts around the planet.</p>

  <p>Being a superb engineer, Connie firmly believed that technology led to
  scientific discovery. Like others, he was preoccupied with the improvement of
  the sensitivity of radio astronomy receivers, and applied physics to new
  designs. In 1959, Connie collaborated with Charles Townes and his students at
  Columbia in the first application of the maser to astronomy. When Townes
  received the 1964 Nobel Prize for the invention of the maser, he asserted that
  Connie's desire to improve receiver sensitivity was influential in his work
  and shared a portion of his prize money with him.</p>

  <p>Connie's greatest contribution was in the study of non-thermal radio
  sources at very short wavelengths. Non-thermal sources were recognized by the
  fact that their flux density decreases with increasing frequency. If the
  emission mechanism were synchrotron radiation (as theorized in 1950), then the
  radiation should be linearly polarized up to a theoretical maximum of 70
  percent. In 1949, John Bolton had identified a discrete radio source with the
  Crab Nebula optical counterpart. The optical radiation was known to contain a
  diffuse component with a featureless spectrum. The Russian astrophysicist
  Joseph Shklovsky boldly hypothesized that both the optical and radio emissions
  were due to the synchrotron mechanism. This implied that the optical radiation
  would be polarized, and Soviet scientists found it so in 1954. Soon after, the
  radio source Virgo A was matched with the peculiar galaxy M87, whose
  spectrally featureless optical jet was found to be polarized in 1956. Thus the
  crucial evidence in support of the synchrotron mechanism for both galactic and
  extragalactic radio sources was the detection of polarization in their optical
  radiation. The very next year, Connie and his collaborators showed that at a 3
  cm wavelength, the Crab Nebula was substantially polarized (8%) at a position
  angle close to that of the optical direction. The hundreds of pixels
  obtainable in the optical, as opposed to only one in the NRL 3 cm observation,
  enabled the variation of position angle with sky position to be measured. Five
  years later, the NRL group, succeeded in measuring the first polarization in
  two extragalactic radio sources, Cygnus A and Centaurus A, at 3 cm. Later
  measurements at slightly longer wavelengths showed that polarization must be
  common in synchrotron sources, but that the amount decreased rapidly with
  increasing wavelength.</p>

  <p>It was already evident from the NRL measurements that Faraday rotation was
  important, and it was also clear that increased resolution would be required
  to remove the effects of averaging over distributions with varying position
  angles. This led Connie to build receivers at even shorter wavelengths and to
  use them on larger telescopes than NRL's. The most spectacular results were
  obtained in 1966 with a 1.55 cm receiver on the NRAO 140-ft reflector at Green
  Bank, which provided a beam width of only 1?:7. They found that the Crab
  Nebula had a distribution of polarization similar to that observed optically,
  reaching up to 16%. Internal Faraday rotation was clearly required to explain
  the rapid depolarization with increasing wavelength. For Cygnus A, they had
  just enough resolution to show that the two components of the double radio
  source were nearly orthogonally polarized.</p>

  <p>Their most beautiful result was on the galactic supernova remnant Cassiopea
  A, where they found a remarkable circular circumferential symmetry in the
  polarization vectors, explaining why previous work with poorer resolution
  indicated no polarization. Most importantly they recognized that the implied
  radial field "suggests that the magnetic field has been carried out with the
  expansion of the supernova envelope, and...[they] observe[d] polarized
  radiation associated with a component which has been stretched out in the
  radial direction during the expansion of the shell." This landmark paper led
  the way for later polarimetric studies of both galactic and extragalactic
  radio sources. Observations two decades later with the VLA (the world's most
  powerful, synthesis radio telescope with a quarter million pixels to each one
  of Connie's), substantiated most or all of his early conclusions, and was a
  tribute to his pioneering effort.</p>

  <p>The NRL group was later involved in discoveries about the variability of
  interstellar water and SiO masers, the structure of molecular clouds and star
  forming regions, the development of techniques for precision time transfer,
  remote sensing of the ocean and atmosphere, and much else, but in the
  aforementioned radio astronomy work, Connie Mayer had no peer. A colleague
  remarked, "Connie was among the last of the scientist-engineers who built
  their own equipment, performed their own experiments, and also interpreted the
  results into paradigm shifting science."</p>

  <p>Connie was a rare and noble example of natural modesty, becoming
  uncomfortable if anyone praised him. After his death, his wife found many
  awards that he had received but never framed nor told her about. He joked that
  he did not want a formal funeral "with a lot of people getting up and mouthing
  off about me." He received full military honor services at Arlington National
  Cemetery, but was cremated as per his wishes. He is survived by Carey
  Whitehead Mayer, his wife of fifty-six years, and their daughter, Carolyn
  Elizabeth Mayer. Their son, John, died in 1978.</p>
