  <p>Gerald Edward Kron ("Gerry") pursued high-precision photometry with
  photoelectric instrumentation of his design, primarily of variable stars and
  star clusters, aimed at advancing the field of stellar populations and
  interstellar reddening. He worked at Lick Observatory, at the Flagstaff
  Station of the US Naval Observatory, and at Mt. Stromlo.</p>

  <p>Kron was
  born in Milwaukee on April 6, 1913, the son of a mechanic. He earned a
  graduate degree in mechanical engineering in 1934 at the University of
  Wisconsin, Madison, and was a protégé there of Joel Stebbins. He accompanied
  Stebbins and Albert Whitford to Mt. Wilson for summer observing runs beginning
  in 1935. He obtaining his PhD in astronomy in 1938 from the University of
  California, Berkeley, and worked at Lick Observatory as a staff member until
  1965. During World War II Kron was a civilian scientist, first with MIT's
  Radiation Laboratory in radar development, then at Caltech in solid-propellant
  rocket development. He was Head of the Special Devices Group at the Naval
  Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California. He married astronomer
  Katherine C. Gordon in Pasadena on April 22, 1946. He served as President of
  the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and served two terms as President of
  IAU Commission No. 9 (Instrumentation). In 1965, when the astronomical staff
  at Mt. Hamilton moved to the new University of California campus at Santa
  Cruz, the Krons opted to move to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Gerald took the
  position of Director of the US Naval Observatory until 1973. He was a Senior
  Research Fellow at the Australian National University during 1974-1976. He
  continued his research program and was otherwise professionally active in
  retirement until the late 1980's. In 1985 he and Katherine moved to Honolulu,
  then returned to Arizona permanently in 1998. He died in Sedona, Arizona, on
  April 9, 2012.</p>

  <p>His scientific work featured photometry of variable
  stars (eclipsing binaries, interacting binaries, pulsating stars, and eruptive
  variables) and stars of extreme luminosity (supergiants and late M dwarfs).
  His photometric measurements were of unprecedented precision and enabled such
  things as the determination of limb-darkening parameters for eclipsing binary
  systems. He pioneered near-infrared measurements of eclipsing binaries, and
  with Gordon used such data to argue for an extended electron-scattering
  atmosphere surrounding the Wolf-Rayet binary V 444 Cyg. He discovered the
  equivalent of sunspots on other stars. He and Gordon were the first to measure
  photoelectrically the light curve of a flare on a dMe star. He exploited the
  6-color photometric system of Stebbins and Whitford to measure the colors of
  star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Fornax dwarf galaxy, thus
  discovering, with Ben Gascoigne, the population of blue globular clusters and
  the bimodality of the cluster color distribution. Based on his measured
  color-luminosity relation for stars with known parallax, Kron demonstrated how
  to determine accurate reddening values for more distant Cepheids and star
  clusters. Comparison of Cepheids in the Galaxy with those in the Magellanic
  Clouds showed that the latter were bluer and varied with lower amplitude. His
  work on reddening, the luminosities of Cepheids, and population
  characteristics of both Cepheids and clusters helped refine the distance
  scale.</p>

  <p>His research covered a number of other topics, such as
  demonstrating that the near-infrared light of the night sky was dominated by
  OH (as opposed to N2) emission; measuring the brightness and color of the Sun
  on prevailing stellar photometric systems; with Nicholas Mayall, undertaking
  large-aperture photometry of Galactic globular clusters; and, with Donald
  Shane, determining the photometric depth of the Shane-Wirtanen galaxy counts
  and calibrating Fritz Zwicky’s magnitudes for bright galaxies.</p>

  <p>Kron's engineering background and interests allowed him to make several
  important contributions to instrumentation. He and Whitford developed the
  first auto-guider for a telescope, as demonstrated on the Mt. Wilson 60-inch
  in 1936. Immediately following World War II, Kron was in large measure
  responsible for introducing photomultipliers, specifically the RCA 1P21, into
  routine astronomical use, based on his identification of low-noise tubes,
  amplifier design, and access to war-surplus recorders. He exploited André
  Lallemand's infrared-sensitive photocathodes and further developed
  photometers, for example optics for fields up to 15 arc minutes in diameter,
  and copper sulfate cells to block the red leak of ultraviolet filters. His
  designs were intended to be duplicated and were published in detail, one
  consequence being that amateur astronomers could take advantage of this
  technology.</p>

  <p>With Mayall, in 1944 he met with Robert Sproul,
  President of the University of California, to discuss options for a large
  reflector for Lick Observatory, an idea that eventually led to the
  construction of the Shane 3-m Telescope. Kron was later involved in design
  specifications for the telescope and aspects of its construction.</p>

  <p>In the late 1950's he began the development of an electronographic
  camera, whereby electrostatic optics re-imaged electrons produced by a large
  photocathode onto a nuclear-track emulsion. Similar technologies were being
  developed by J. D. McGee in London and Lallemand in Paris. The benefits with
  respect to photography included much higher quantum efficiency, a linear
  response to light, low noise, and a high dynamic range, features with enormous
  potential to advance astronomical two-dimensional photometry. A key problem
  with the McGee and Lallemand systems was either the need for a mica window to
  separate the plate from the vacuum, or the need to break the vacuum (and thus
  destroy the cathode) to retrieve the plate. Kron patented a valve internal to
  the evacuated volume that sealed off the cathode to enable the plate to be
  removed and replaced relatively conveniently, and without the need for a mica
  window. The Kron electronographic camera was adopted at a few observatories
  and even saw some commercial development. It enjoyed a run of scientific
  utility (e.g. surface brightness profiles of globular clusters and surface
  photometry of galaxies) before solid-state sensors made the bulky high-vacuum
  systems obsolete.</p>

  <p>Gerald Kron led an active life and pursued a
  number of passions. As a graduate student he traveled from the Berkeley campus
  to Mt. Hamilton on his motorcycle, and later he enjoyed tinkering with British
  sports cars. He constructed model steam engines in his home workshop. He built
  an ultraviolet-sensitive photometer to monitor the amount of ambient UV light
  at various locations, altitudes, and times of day, to document human exposure
  levels. He once quipped that he "invented things that worked but nobody
  wanted, or that people wanted but didn't work." He recreated Daguerre's
  photographic process, obtaining a daguerrotype of Katherine with the family
  Willys Jeep. His interests turned to 16-mm filmmaking, documenting family
  trips to islands in the South Pacific. He had a lifelong interest in music and
  skillfully played the piano for relaxation. He is survived by his brother
  Robert and four of his five children.</p>
