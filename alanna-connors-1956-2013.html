  Center for Astrophysics</a>.</em></p>

  <p>Our friend, mentor, and colleague Alanna Connors passed away on February 2,
  2013. She had been fighting cancer for 16 years.</p>

  <p>Alanna was born on
  September 25 1956 in Hong Kong and grew up in Greenwich, CT. She received her
  undergraduate physics degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
  1978 and a Doctorate in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Maryland in
  1988. Her thesis, written based upon research conducted at NASA's Goddard
  Space Flight Center, was on Fast X-ray Transients. She went on to make
  significant contributions to the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Alanna was
  also a research scientist at the Space Science Center at the University of New
  Hampshire, and a visiting Professor at Wellesley College. She was a founding
  member of the international astrostatistics collaboration CHASC at Harvard
  University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>

  <p>Alanna was a pioneer in the development of principled Bayesian methods to
  apply to astrophysical problems. As a longtime advocate of rigorous data
  analysis, she introduced many people to the joys of Bayesian statistics. Her
  research in X-rays and later gamma-ray astrophysics required solid statistical
  methods which were generally unknown to astronomers in the early nineties. At
  a time when Bayesian analysis was out of favor in Statistics, and detailed
  statistical analyses were not generally considered in astrophysics, she was
  farsighted enough to realize they were both necessary for future progress, and
  worked ceaselessly to promulgate these ideas. She developed a search detection
  algorithm with Poisson maximum likelihood for X-ray transients and used it on
  the HEAO-1 A2 X-ray data in her first research paper published in
  Astrophysical Journal in 1986 (ApJ 303, 769), which became part of her Ph.D.
  thesis. When she started working with CGRO Comptel data she also became
  interested in detection and characterization of gamma-ray bursts. She was
  among the first to recognize the potential of the Bayesian Blocks algorithm;
  her work provided early demonstrations of its capabilities for detecting
  gamma-ray bursts and pulsars. Besides being a trailblazer in Bayesian
  astrostatistics, Alanna was also among the earliest to see the promise of
  Python for data analysis in astronomy, participating as a co-investigator on
  one of the earliest NASA-funded projects building Python statistical software
  for astronomers.</p>

  <p>Alanna was a perennial source of encouragement to
  students and other researchers she met at Conferences, and was always
  available to discuss algorithms, methodologies, and problems. Her
  encouragement and participation were critical to the success of the CHASC
  collaboration that was set up between high-energy astronomers and
  statisticians at Harvard in the wake of the launch of the Chandra X-Ray
  Observatory. That the collaboration has grown to be as productive as it has
  owes a great deal to her ability to notice where astronomical analyses were
  lacking and where principled analysis could contribute to correct it. A case
  in point was her realization that astronomers were misusing the ubiquitous
  F-test. This led directly to one of the most influential papers to come out of
  the CHASC collaboration, "Statistics, Handle with Care: Detecting Multiple
  Model Components with the Likelihood Ratio Test" (ApJ 571, 545).</p>

  <p>She had a felicity with principled statistical analysis that was the envy
  of most people. The mathematics of the Poisson distribution came easily to
  her. Indeed, no talk or presentation of hers was complete without her standing
  in front of a complicated mathematical expression and trying to explain that
  it was actually very simple and straightforward. She put this expertise to
  good use in developing Bayesian image deconvolution methods, first with EMC2,
  and then with LIRA. It is due to her efforts that it has become possible to
  speak of the significance of a 2D feature. The initial work was described by
  in the review published as part of the Statistical Challenges in Modern
  Astronomy conference in 2007. She continued to refine the method over the past
  few years, and was working on it to the very end.</p>

  <p>Alanna's most
  far-reaching and enduring impact may well come from her tireless outreach
  efforts, both outreach to colleagues through her efforts on astrostatistics
  education, and her outreach to the public. She organized dozens of workshops
  and special astrostatistics sessions at conferences dedicated to highlighting
  new methodologies and clever algorithms. But she never lost sight of the
  purpose of these tools. She always grounded her work in astronomically
  relevant cases, as for instance disentangling the cosmic gamma-ray background
  from the galactic, which she used as the primary motivator for LIRA.</p>

  <p>She also had an interest in public science education. She taught
  astrophysics at Wellesley College, contributed to university physics
  instruction at UNH and UMD, contributed to public education in science through
  projects at The Christa McAuliffe Planetarium at Concord NH, participated in
  family science days at her son's elementary school, and encouraged exploratory
  science learning and teaching through many other avenues. An abiding interest
  in the history of physics and astronomy from its ancient origins, in welcoming
  women's participation in physics, and celebrating stories of diverse
  contributors to science underlay her service on the American Physical Society
  Forum for the History of Physics, and other projects.</p>

  <p>Beloved wife
  of Phillip Alan Veatch, loving mother of Roy Micah Veatch, Alanna filled all
  of her life exploring the wonders of the world and sharing her smile and
  caring with friends, relatives, colleagues, and strangers. She died at home in
  the arms of her family. Alanna is survived by her mother Sonia Connors of
  Arlington, MA; sisters Cynthia Connors of Brooklyn, NY, Kathleen Connors of
  Hau'ula, Oahu, HI, Noirin Connors of London, England; and her brother Patrick
  Connors of New York, NY.</p>
