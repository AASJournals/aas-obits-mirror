  <p>It is with great sadness that I announce the passing away of longtime AAVSO
  member and observer Thomas A. Cragg. According to his beloved wife, Mary, Tom
  passed peacefully on 6 May 2011 at 1 pm (New South Wales, Australia, time).
  Tom had been ill for about a year following a series of strokes. His funeral
  will be in Coonabarabran on Tuesday, May 10, and he will be buried in the
  Native Grove Cemetery there.</p>

  <p>Those of us fortunate to know Tom personally will remember his twinkling
  eyes, ready smile, and hearty laugh, his willingness to help with projects
  large and small, his excitement over and persistence in trying to observe
  anything asked of him (no matter how difficult the target or how
  sleep-deprived it might make him), his dedication and loyalty and
  professionalism. His old friends called him Tommy, and this boyish nickname
  suited him.</p>

  <p>Tom joined the AAVSO in 1945 at the age of 17, already excited about
  astronomy and eager to participate in the AAVSO observing programs. He was an
  avid and prolific variable star observer, amassing a lifetime total of 157,056
  observations, of which all but 5 were visual (the 5 were CCD). He was also a
  dedicated solar observer. Tom observed all kinds of variable stars, and took
  advantage of his location after moving to Australia to monitor many unstudied
  or neglected southern variables. When Tom lived in California, he often
  observed at <a href="https://www.aavso.org/clinton-ford-observatory">Ford
  Observatory</a> with Clinton Ford, Charles Scovil, Monsignor Ron Royer, and
  other AAVSO'ers involved in chart and sequence work and in expanding the AAVSO
  observing program. His longevity with the AAVSO meant that Tom "served" under
  the leadership, successively, of Leon Campbell, Margaret Mayall, Janet Mattei,
  and Arne Henden - what a ride!</p>

  <p>Tom served three terms on the AAVSO Council: 1951-1953, 1962-1964, and
  1964-1966. He had a strong interest for many years in Cepheid variables, and
  served as chair of the AAVSO Cepheid Committee from the years when Cepheids
  were of great interest to the professional community until the committee's
  dissolution in the late 1980s, its goals achieved.</p>

  <p>Tom was the recipient of numerous AAVSO awards, including the
  25<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://www.aavso.org/merit-award">Merit Award</a>,
  the <a href="https://www.aavso.org/directors-award">Director's Award</a>, a <a
  href="https://www.aavso.org/solar-observer-awards">Solar Honor Award</a>, <a
  href="https://www.aavso.org/observer-awards">Observer Awards</a> for visual
  observations through the 150,000 observations level, and a <a
  href="https://www.aavso.org/novasupernova-award">Supernova Award</a> (for
  assisting Robert O. Evans in his discovery of SN 1995V in NGC 1087).</p>

  <p>Among Tom's other honors is the Astronomical League's <a
  href="https://www.aavso.org/astronomical-leagues-leslie-c-peltier-award">Leslie
  C. Peltier Award</a> for his work in variable stars and lunar and planetary
  astronomy. Minor planet (5068) Cragg is named in Tom's honor.</p>

  <p>In his professional career, Tom's astronomical work included being an
  observer at Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, California, for many
  years, then serving for many more years as an observer at Siding Spring
  Observatory near Coonabarabran, New South Wales, Australia.</p>

  <p>Tom was a talented musician who played the flute beautifully; attendees at
  the AAVSO's 75th Anniversary meeting in 1986 will remember his skilled and
  charming performance on several different flutes he had brought with him from
  Australia.</p>

  <p>Tom Cragg gave unselfishly of himself and his talents to variable star
  astronomy and the AAVSO for over 60 years. Thank you, Tom.</p>

  <p>He is a good soul who is patient and cheerful on the telephone when awoken
  by a young Headquarters assistant after just having gone soundly to sleep
  following an all-night observing session and has a Siamese cat jumping on him
  and yowling in his other ear for attention - I speak from personal experience
  that Tom was indeed such when I miscalculated the time difference between
  Cambridge and Coonabarabran and ruined his sleep. I shall miss that good soul.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth O. Waagen, Senior Technical Assistant, AAVSO</p>
