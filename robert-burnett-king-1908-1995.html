      <h1>Robert Burnett King (1908-1995)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Robert King was born in Pasadena on 6 June 1908, the elder of two sons of
  Arthur Scott King (1876-1957), a noted laboratory spectroscopist who was
  superintendent of the Physical Laboratory at Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO)
  from 1908 until 1943. Bob therefore came into contact with astronomers during
  visits to his father's laboratory and developed a natural appreciation for the
  activities and lifestyle at a major scientific research institution.</p>

  <p>Bob attended Pomona College from 1926 to 1930 where he concentrated in
  physics and astronomy and decided to take up astronomy, a decision that
  greatly pleased his father. Partly through his father's contacts with Henry
  Norris Russell, Bob obtained a research assistantship in the astronomy
  department at Princeton University for the following year. After his first
  year at Princeton Bob married Helen Leonard, whom he had met at Pomona.</p>

  <p>The summer after graduation Bob worked with his father in the Mount Wilson
  Physical Laboratory and obtained invaluable and unique practical laboratory
  experience. His analysis of the spark spectrum of ionized cerium resulted in
  his first scientific publication in 1932, and was the beginning of a long and
  fruitful collaboration between the two Kings. He did nearly all of his
  experimental research there, returning every summer while attending graduate
  school and between his three academic years as a physics instructor at
  MIT.</p>

  <p>At Princeton Bob took astronomy courses but concentrated on physics,
  studying spectroscopy under A. G. Shenstone. Russell took a close interest in
  Bob's career, partly because he saw in Bob an opportunity to strengthen the
  bond between his Princeton group and experimental spectroscopy at Mount
  Wilson. Both Arthur King and Russell persuaded Bob to undertake a doctoral
  thesis on Zeeman effects in sunspot spectra, based upon high-quality data from
  the Mount Wilson 150-foot tower telescope which had never been fully analyzed.
  Bob applied new insights from recent advances in quantum mechanics, and was
  awarded the PhD in astronomy in 1933.</p>

  <p>King obtained a National Research Council (NRC) postdoctoral fellowship for
  1933-1935 to continue spectroscopic research at the Mount Wilson laboratory.
  There he began experimental measurements of <em>f</em>-values, or oscillator
  strengths, to obtain quantitative analyses of line intensities in stellar
  spectra. When King began experimental <em>f</em>-value determinations in 1933,
  reliable <em>f</em>-values were known for only a handful of lines, but these
  mainly were for resonance lines of elements of limited astrophysical
  significance. At Mount Wilson, Bob used the King furnace built and refined by
  his father for the initial determinations of relative <em>f</em>-values for
  several hundred lines of iron, titanium and vanadium which are abundant in
  solar-type spectra. In 1935 King accepted a three-year appointment as
  instructor in physics at MIT where he taught freshman physics. In
  collaboration with Donald Stockbarger of the MIT physics faculty, Bob began to
  design and construct a special closed-cell electric furnace that they would
  later use at Mount Wilson in the first attempts to measure absolute
  <em>f</em>-values for iron-group elements.</p>

  <p>In 1938, King returned to the Mount Wilson laboratory as assistant
  physicist. Arthur King was approaching mandatory retirement age and Bob was
  the leading candidate to take over. In early 1942, with the nation at war,
  King joined the Caltech Rocket Project which was formed to develop small,
  solid-propellant rockets. He became the leader of the Fuse Group, consisting
  of about eight PhD scientists and engineers plus supporting draftsmen,
  machinists, and technicians. One of his group's early successes was an
  antisubmarine rocket fuse which entered combat in late 1942. King and his team
  received a Naval Ordnance Development Award in 1945 and a Presidential
  Certificate of Merit in 1948.</p>

  <p>Bob King returned to Mount Wilson in January 1946, just as the first of
  several organizational changes prompted by the imminent completion of the
  200-inch Hale telescope were taking place. Between resumption of war-suspended
  work on the 200-inch mirror in 1946 and the dedication at Palomar in 1948, a
  detailed agreement was worked out between Caltech and the Carnegie Institution
  for joint operation of the combined observatories to be known as the Mount
  Wilson and Palomar Observatories. This included a reorganized Division of
  Physics, Mathematics, Astronomy, and Electrical Engineering, and Caltech would
  henceforth offer graduate degrees in astronomy and astrophysics.</p>

  <p>Creation of the combined Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories was a major
  turning point in Bob King's career. Ira S. Bowen, who became director of MWO
  in 1946 and succeeded to the directorship of the combined observatories in
  1948, called upon King to supervise Caltech doctoral students wishing to do
  spectroscopy. The first two of King's Ph.D. students began experimental work
  at the Santa Barbara Street laboratory in 1946, but King soon moved to the
  Caltech campus to take advantage of the large and well-equipped facilities
  there. Accordingly, on 30 June 1948, King became associate professor of
  physics at Caltech. Even so, the King furnace and large grating spectrographs
  at Santa Barbara Street continued to be used into the 1960s by King and
  several of his students for a number of research studies requiring these
  unique facilities.</p>

  <p>Bob King spent the next 20 years as professor of physics at Caltech,
  attaining full professorial rank in 1952. At Caltech emphasis was on research
  and on supervision of graduate research theses. Bob kept a regular, but rather
  light, teaching load of graduate level optics and spectroscopy courses. He
  frequently served as the physics representative on astronomy PhD oral
  examination committees, in addition to many in physics. He supervised 13
  Caltech doctorates, and continued research on the experimental determination
  of <em>f</em>-values for astrophysically important atomic spectra. As the
  years progressed, requirements for additional relative <em>f</em>-value
  studies leveled off and emphasis shifted to the considerably more difficult
  problem of the precision determination of absolute <em>f</em>-values for a few
  key lines of selected elements. In the mid 1950s, King's group inaugurated a
  series of absorption experiments based on atomic beam methods and eventually
  obtained excellent <em>f</em>-value results. During the 1950s and 1960s,
  King's Caltech group was one of about four leading centers worldwide
  conducting this type of experimental work.</p>

  <p>In June 1968, at age 60, Bob took early retirement and moved to his ocean
  front home near Mendocino in northern California. The Kings enjoyed 20 years
  of quality retirement there playing golf and travelling. In 1988, at age 80,
  he suffered a stroke, and though he recovered somewhat he and his wife moved
  back to Pasadena to be near to their two daughters' families and to be closer
  to specialized medical care. Bob suffered declining health but remained alert,
  passing away peacefully in his sleep on 12 January 1995 at age 86. He is
  survived by Helen L. King, his wife of 64 years, two daughters, and three
  grandsons.</p>

  <p>Robert King was highly regarded, especially by his students, who benefited
  greatly from his helpful advice and quiet guidance. He was a kind and modest
  gentleman, liked and respected by all who knew him. A March 1992 oral history
  is on file at the American Institute of Physics and was used in drafting this
  notice, as was a draft chapter from a biography of Henry Norris Russell by
  David DeVorkin. For a more detailed memorial and a bibliographical listing of
  King's work, contact the first author.</p>
