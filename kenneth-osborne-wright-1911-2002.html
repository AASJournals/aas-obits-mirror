  <p>Kenneth Osborne Wright died of the effects of Parkinson's disease on 25
  July 2002, nearly nine months after celebrating his ninetieth birthday. He was
  born in Fort George, British Columbia, Canada, to Charles Melville and Agnes
  Pearl née Osborne Wright on 1 November 1911. His father was a minister. Ken
  spent almost all his life and virtually all his professional career in his
  native province. His student years, however, were spent at the University of
  Toronto. He graduated with a BA in 1933, winning the Gold Medal awarded by the
  Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) for the best student in the
  graduating astronomy class. Ken earned an MA in Astronomy in 1934, also at
  Toronto. During the academic year 1934–1935, Ken was an astronomical assistant
  at the University of Toronto. During the following academic year he held a
  similar post in the University of Michigan. In 1936, Ken returned to British
  Columbia to take up a full-time appointment on the staff of the Dominion
  Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) in Victoria. He was awarded a PhD from the
  University of Michigan in 1940 for a dissertation based on his research at
  DAO. Except for short absences at the University of Toronto (1960–1961), Mount
  Wilson and Palomar Observatories (1962) and Amherst-Mount Holyoke Colleges
  (1962), Ken remained at the DAO until he reached the then mandatory retirement
  age of 65 in 1976. For the last ten years of that period, he was the DAO’s
  director. Precluded from active war service by a defect in one eye, Ken also
  served as a lecturer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver during
  1943 and 1944.</p>

  <p>When Ken arrived at the DAO in 1936, virtually all work there was stellar
  spectroscopy (carried out, of course, with photographic plates) and,
  particularly, studies of spectroscopic binaries. Ken's dominant interest, the
  structure and chemical abundances of stellar atmospheres, fitted well with the
  Observatory programs. From early days he engaged in curve-of-growth analyses
  of stellar spectra. This naturally led him to consider the precision with
  which line intensities could be measured on stellar spectra—a topic ideally
  suited to his temperament. While, on his own admission, Ken could sometimes be
  hasty and hot-tempered with colleagues, for stars and spectrograms he had
  almost endless patience. Few of us took as much care as he did in focusing the
  spectrograph at the beginning of the night and even fewer were prepared to
  spend all night, and sometimes even two or three consecutive nights, to obtain
  just one plate. Nevertheless, with the early spectrographs in Victoria, that
  was often the only way to record as far as possible into the ultraviolet.</p>

  <p>The conversion of a photographic record into an intensity trace must seem
  arcane to those who have grown up with solid-state linear detectors, to say
  nothing of computers. In the old days, spectrogram reduction required two
  stages; for each stage there was an instrument—a microphotometer and an
  intensitometer. Each of these instruments at Victoria had been designed by C.
  S. Beals, but Ken was probably their most frequent and most skilled user.
  Drawing the continuum for a late-type spectrum was a challenge in itself and,
  finally, when the intensity trace was complete, the measurements had to be
  made. Ken was frequently to be found on his knees, carefully examining a
  tracing that stretched the entire length of the corridor outside his office!
  Ken’s dedication to this field was recognized by his peers when they elected
  him, in 1952, as president of IAU Sub-Commission 29b on Standard Line
  Intensities in Stellar Spectra. He served in that role for twelve years.</p>

  <p>The climax of this work, and the fruit of Ken's efforts in Commission 29b,
  was a paper published in 1963, in the DAO Publications, which Ken wrote with
  the assistance of E. K. Lee and T. V. Jacobson and the collaboration of his
  friend J. L. Greenstein. Although modern detectors, with their high
  signal-to-noise ratios, and our improved theoretical knowledge of stellar
  atmospheres have greatly increased our ability to interpret the data, this
  paper stands as one of the most comprehensive discussions available of the
  variations of line intensities with spectral type along the main sequence. A
  second paper with T.V. Jacobson, published a little later, also considered the
  variations of line-intensity ratios with luminosity class in spectra of late
  types.</p>

  <p>Another area of interest for Ken was that of long-period eclipsing binaries
  containing a supergiant component. Almost everyone at the DAO in the 1950s
  participated in the observation of these systems but Ken was the one who
  continued the work and made it especially his own. This was partly because the
  premature deaths of Andrew McKellar and Robert Petrie left him as the last
  active observer of the group that initiated the program, but study of these
  systems was also suited to his particular kind of patience. Few people are
  prepared, these days, to invest a lot of time in intensive observation of a
  prolonged eclipse, only to have to wait years before being able to repeat the
  observations. Of course, Ken's principal interest was in the atmospheric
  phases of the eclipses, when the light of the early-type companion acts as a
  probe, revealing the structure of the supergiant atmosphere. However, a
  by-product of his work was orbital elements of several of the brighter systems
  of this type. In particular, his orbital elements for VV Cephei remain the
  best available.</p>

  <p>Ken was made assistant director of the DAO in 1960, after the early but not
  unexpected death of Andrew McKellar. He became director in 1966, after the
  sudden death of Robert M. Petrie. Naturally, there was less time for
  scientific research in his new position. It was his misfortune to be plunged
  into a senior administrative position at the time of considerable division
  within the Canadian astronomical community over the location of a proposed
  major new instrument. This division eventually led to the cancellation of the
  project amid fears, in some quarters, that Canadian astronomers would be
  denied access to large telescopes. Ken's persistence in supporting the efforts
  of G. J. Odgers to find alternative projects was a major factor in the
  eventual Canadian participation in the CFH Telescope, and thus, indirectly, in
  the other large-telescope projects in which Canadian astronomers are now
  involved. The difficulty of those times was increased for him by the illness
  and death, in 1969, of his first wife Margaret.</p>

  <p>Ken was always ready to encourage amateur astronomers and he was active
  both in the RASC’s Victoria Centre and at the national level of the society—he
  served as the RASC president from 1964 to 1966. In November 1940, Ken
  coordinated both local amateurs and the DAO staff in observations of a transit
  of Mercury, visible from Victoria.</p>

  <p>Ken was also active in the wider community of Victoria. As an honorary
  professor of physics at the University of Victoria from 1965 to 1981, he
  served in the academic senate of that institution from 1973 to 1978. He was,
  for many years an elder of First United Church in Victoria. Among the
  honors Ken received, were election as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada
  in 1954 and an honorary doctorate (DSc) from the Nicholas Copernicus
  University in Torun, bestowed in 1973 during the Extraordinary General
  Assembly of the IAU held in Poland to celebrate the quincentenary of the birth
  of Copernicus.</p>

  <p>Ken married twice—to Margaret Sharp in 1937 and, after her death, to Jean
  Ellis, who died about a year before he did. He is survived by one daughter
  from the first marriage, Mrs. Nora Osborne.</p>

  <p>In all that Ken did, he set himself the highest standards and was
  conscientious and meticulous in the extreme. His integrity was rock-like and
  his word completely reliable. If Ken sometimes criticized people quite
  strongly to their faces, they could be certain that he would never say
  anything behind their backs that he was not prepared to say directly to them,
  and he never nursed grudges. Astronomy and the DAO have changed much in the
  quarter-century since his retirement, but Ken left his mark on each of them.</p>
