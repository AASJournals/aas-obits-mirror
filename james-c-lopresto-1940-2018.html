  <p>James Charles LoPresto, longtime solar researcher based at Edinboro
  University in Edinboro, Pennsylvania, passed away on 8 October 2018 after a
  long illness. Born on 25 June 1940 to the late Charles and Jessie (Bellomo)
  LoPresto in Jamestown, New York, and a 1958 graduate of Jamestown High School,
  LoPresto obtained his B.S. in Physics and Astronomy, with a Math Minor, from
  Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1962 and
  his M.S. in Astronomy from Case in 1965. Following a period working at Kitt
  Peak National Observatory, he resumed his academic studies, receiving his
  Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the University of Michigan in 1974.</p>

  <p>In 1971, LoPresto joined the staff at Edinboro University, where he taught
  astronomy and directed the observatory until his retirement in 2011. He
  conducted research at a number of facilities, including Kitt Peak; the High
  Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado; Goddard Space Flight Center in
  Greenbelt, Maryland; Sacramento Peak Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico; and
  California Institute of Technology and JPL. Among his research interests were
  red giant computer modeling and spectral synthesis; measurement of the solar
  gravitational redshift; ultra-high resolution solar spectroscopy; and solar
  activity and solar irradiance. In addition to some 45 research articles,
  LoPresto published a popular-level book <i>Space-Time: Fabric of the
  Universe</i> (Allegheny Press, 1995).</p>

  <p>LoPresto was an early adopter of internet-facilitated instruction, his
  self-styled “Paperless Classroom” materials and exams initially hosted on a
  VAX computer in 1985. He foresaw the growth of Web-based distance learning and
  electronic interactivity between students and their instructor. He was also a
  popular speaker at academic institutions, civic organizations, and astronomy
  clubs, and, during the summers, oversaw the solar physics segment of the Mount
  Wilson Consortium for Undergraduate Students for Research in Astronomy
  (CUREA).</p>

  <p>In 2003, LoPresto donated to Edinboro University his self-designed Maize
  Sunfire Observatory, located near Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. The
  facility includes two observatory buildings, computers and other scientific
  equipment. Having completed the solar observatory in 1998, he subsequently
  combined a NASA grant, gift from an anonymous donor, and his own money to add
  a second observatory housing a 20-inch robotic Ritchey-Chretien reflecting
  telescope by Torus Technologies. The instrument can be controlled remotely by
  students on the Edinboro campus four miles away.</p>

  <p>James LoPresto is survived by his wife, Maureen (Hanlon) LoPresto; his
  sons, Michael (Jan), of Saline, Michigan and John (Lisa), of Elkton, Maryland;
  their mother, Mel (Juskenas) LoPresto, of Edinboro; and five grandchildren,
  Sarah (Anthony), Emily, Sam, Luke and Mark.</p>
