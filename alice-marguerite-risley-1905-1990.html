      <h1>Alice Marguerite Risley (1905-1990)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Marguerite Risley is remembered as a friendly, dignified and gracious lady,
  highly capable in both research and teaching. She was born in Wanakena, New
  York, on September 2, 1905, attended Syracuse University of Jamesville, New
  York, earning an A.B. in 1926 and A.M. in 1928. In 1942 she was awarded the
  Ph.D.degree at Radcliffe College. Meanwhile, in 1926-27, she taught high
  school at Shortsville, N.Y. Most of her subsequent career she spent at
  Randolph Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, where she was
  instructor in mathematics from 1928 to 1939, Assistant Professor in
  Mathematics and Astronomy 1939-45, Associate Professor 1945-55, and finally
  full Professor 1955 until her retirement in 1971.</p>

  <p>She had been given leave of absence from Randolph-Macon in 1937-39 in order
  to work toward her Ph.D. at Radcliffe College. Professor Bart. J. Bok at
  Harvard College Observatory was her thesis advisor, stimulating and
  encouraging her research interests.</p>

  <p>At the larger universities, the policy of "publish or perish" was sometimes
  apt to mitigate against first rate teaching of undergraduates. At small
  colleges, on the other hand, especially at women's colleges, teaching was
  always stressed significantly above research. Thus, back in Virginia, Miss
  Risley found little time fot research; in fact, the standard astronomical
  bibliography, the <em>Jahresbericht</em> of the German Astronomische
  Gesellschaft, followed by <em>Astronomy and Astrophysics Abstracts</em>,
  listed only four papers by Risley:</p>

  <p class="rteindent1">"The Milky Way in Cepheus," Ap.J. <strong>97</strong>,
  277-299, 1943, based on her Ph.D. thesis.</p>

  <p class="rteindent1">"A Bright Region in Cepheus," Ap.J.
  <strong>109</strong>,314-320, 1949.</p>

  <p class="rteindent1">"Space Velocities of Mira Variables," by V. Osvalds and
  Risley, Ast. Jour., <strong>65</strong>, 496, 1960 (Abstract).</p>

  <p class="rteindent1">"Absolute Proper Motions, Secular Parallaxes, Absolute
  Magnitudes and Space Velocities of Mira Type Variables," by V. Osvalds and
  Risley, Pub. Leander McCormick Obs., <strong>11</strong>, 147-170, 1961.</p>

  <p>All of these papers involved determinations of stellar magnitudes, colors
  and spectral types. The first two papers show considerable research potential.
  At a time when relatively little was known about interstellar absorption, her
  analysis of the space distributions of stars to 15th photographic magnitude in
  a 750 square degree area in Cepheus was an important pioneering investigation.
  The other two publications, co-authored with Osvalds, have been highly
  appreciated by variable-star astronomers. Previous determinations by others of
  the absolute magnitudes of Mira-type variables had given somewhat discordant
  results. The new investigation was based on more extensive and more precise
  observations than the previous determinations.</p>

  <p>At Randolph-Macon Risley revealed herself as an expert in celestial
  mechanics and galactic structure, two fields in astronomy for which
  mathematics was especially important; and she introduced a course in
  statistics, realizing its importance in astronomical as well as other science
  projects. It was through her efforts that the college acquired a 12-inch
  Cassegrain telescope in 1962. Faculty records noted that "Her efforts brought
  the astronomy program to its highest level since the founding of the
  College."</p>

  <p>As a member of the AAS Teacher's Committee in 1954, in an article in
  <em>Sky and Telescope</em> entitled "One Hundred and One Astronomers" Risley
  reported on the status of teaching in American colleges and universities as
  indicated by responses to questionnaires she had sent to 101 astronomers. This
  article is still of current interest.</p>

  <p>In August-September 1964, while the Director of the Nantucket Maria
  Mitchell Observatory attended meetings of the International Astronomical
  Union, Miss Risley took over as Acting Director. The work there was primarily
  on variable stars, a program designed for research participation for women
  undergraduates. The Observatory had been erected as a memorial to the first
  woman astronomer in the United States, a woman who rose to international fame
  by her discovery of a telescopic comet. Hence, whenever a comet was discovered
  the students took photographs of it. That summer Comet Everhard appeared and
  under Miss Risley's tutelage the students published its positions, derived
  from their own measurements of the photographs they had taken. While in
  Nantucket Dr. Risley also gave three public open night lectures: "Changing
  Views of the Universe", "Exploring the Moon", and "The Sun as a Star",
  revealing a diversity of her interests, which included properly informing the
  public about astronomy. She served on the Astronomy Committee of the Nantucket
  Maria Mitchell Association from 1963 until 1981. Two of her own students
  participated in the Maria Mitchell summer program, one in 1963, the other in
  1967.</p>

  <p>Professional organizations to which Dr. Risley belonged included the
  American Astronomical Society, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the
  American Statistical Association, the Virginia Academy of Science, the
  American Association of Variable Star Observers, the American Association of
  University Professors, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. For a time she was the
  President of the University of Virginia Division of the American Association
  of University Women. In 1956-57 she served on the astronomy program of the
  National Science Foundation. She was also active in the League of Women
  Voters. Finally, after her retirement in 1971, she was appointed Visiting
  Research Associate at the Leander McCormick Observatory of the University of
  Virginia.</p>

  <p>In a memorial to her, the Faculty of Randolph-Macon Women's College stated,
  "Professor Risley was a woman of impeccable integrity and outstanding
  professional competence who spent more than half of her life making important
  contributions to the life and growth of Randolph-Macon Women's College." A
  scholar of tremendous research potential, Marguerite Risley nevertheless
  looked upon teaching as her primary responsibility, a dedication that modem
  harassed educational administrators would like to see emulated.</p>
