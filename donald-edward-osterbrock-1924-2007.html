  <p>Donald Edward Osterbrock, one of the leading figures of post-World War II
  astronomy, died suddenly of a heart attack on 11 January 2007, while walking
  near his office at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He was 82 years
  old. His initials spelled D.E.O. (God in latin!), but he was known simply as
  Don to his many friends and colleagues.</p>

  <p>Don's long and productive career spanned five decades. His scientific work
  helped shape our understanding of lower main-sequence stars, the ionized
  interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei. He was also a highly
  respected historian of astronomy who shed new light on 19th- and 20th-century
  astronomy.</p>

  <p>Don was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 13 July 1924. Both of his parents were
  of German descent and valued hard work, education, and science. They both
  completed their high-school education at night while working full-time during
  the day. His father eventually became a professor of electrical engineering at
  the University of Cincinnati. Don's plan to become an astronomer was put on
  hold when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. After graduation from
  high school, Don joined the United States Army and trained as a meteorologist,
  taking all of the physics and mathematics courses required for a bachelor's
  degree in physics from the University of Chicago. He was eventually sent to
  islands in the Pacific Ocean but never was in harm's way. After three years of
  service, Don returned to Chicago to obtain his bachelor's degree in 1948, his
  M.S. in astronomy in 1949, and a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1952.</p>

  <p>Don's years at the University of Chicago and the University's Yerkes
  Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, were pivotal for his career and
  personal life. He came in contact with such luminaries as Otto Struve, Bengt
  Strömgren, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, and William W. Morgan. At Yerkes, he
  also met and married Irene L. Hansen, a native of Williams Bay, who was
  employed as a member of the Yerkes staff. They had a son, William, now living
  in Santa Cruz; two daughters, Laura of Seattle, Washington, and Carol of Santa
  Cruz; and three grandchildren.</p>

  <p>Don did a theoretical Ph.D. thesis with Chandrasekhar calculating the
  effects of gravitational interactions between interstellar clouds and stars,
  but arguably his best known graduate work was observational in nature, helping
  Morgan map the nearest spiral arms of our Galaxy. Morgan put Don's name on the
  landmark 1952 paper (Morgan, Sharpless, &amp; Osterbrock, AJ, 57, p. 3, 1952),
  even though, according to Don's own account in his 2000 autobiography A
  Fortunate Life in Astronomy, the work was mostly Morgan's. This generous
  gesture by Morgan likely fashioned what was to become Don's own trademark
  generosity towards his Ph.D. students and colleagues for years to come.</p>

  <p>After obtaining his Ph.D. degree, Don spent a single but very productive
  year as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, becoming interested in
  the stellar structures of red dwarfs. Using numerical integration methods
  generously provided by Martin Schwarzschild, Don produced the first models of
  red dwarfs that took into account their outer convective layers (Osterbrock,
  ApJ, 118, pp. 529-546, 1953). These calculations also inspired Fred Hoyle and
  Schwarzschild to successfully model red giant stars with similar convective
  envelopes.</p>

  <p>In 1953, Osterbrock accepted an instructorship at Caltech, joining a young
  astronomy department led by Jesse Greenstein. Direct access to Caltech's
  outstanding astronomical facilities on Mounts Wilson and Palomar marked a
  turning point in Don's career, since it allowed him to pursue his
  observational interests in gaseous nebulae. Drawing on his expertise in atomic
  physics, and a very productive collaboration via air mail with young atomic
  theorist Michael Seaton, he pioneered the use of spectroscopic methods for the
  study of gaseous nebulae.</p>

  <p>In a daring move in 1958, Don left Caltech for the University of Wisconsin,
  to appease his wife's and his own homesickness for the Midwest. There he
  continued his work on gaseous nebulae, both observational and theoretical,
  often as part of the Ph.D. thesis of one of his many excellent graduate
  students. As time went on, Don became increasingly fascinated by the
  emission-line spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and this fed a growing
  need for larger telescope apertures. In 1973, the ``lure of the big telescope
  in the land of clear skies'' (his own words from his 2000 autobiography) won
  out, and he finally accepted the long-pending offer from the Chancellor of the
  University of California at Santa Cruz to become director of Lick
  Observatory.</p>

  <p>Lick's 120-inch telescope and its unique image-dissector scanner were
  ideally suited for the spectroscopic AGN survey that Don had in mind at the
  time. In the decade and a half that followed, Don amassed arguably the best
  and largest collection of high-quality spectra on AGN in the world, published
  several seminal papers based on these unique data, and became in the process
  one of the world's leading authorities on AGN. During that same period, Don
  published his ``little blue book'' on the Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae
  (1974). This textbook and the two subsequent revisions Astrophysics of Gaseous
  Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei (1989 and 2005—the later edition, with
  co-author Gary Ferland) have been the standard references for graduate courses
  and researchers in the field for more than thirty years.</p>

  <p>This prolific period of Don's career was doubly remarkable considering
  that, from 1973 to 1981, he was the Director of Lick Observatory. This was a
  time when tough choices had to be made in order to get the 10-meter Keck
  Telescopes project under way. Don very effectively and diplomatically guided
  the upper echelons of the University of California, Santa Cruz, through this
  process. He also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from
  1988 to 1990, no doubt having too much time on his hands after stepping down
  from the Lick directorship!</p>

  <p>Don received several awards and honors for his research work. In 1991, he
  won lifetime achievement awards from the American Astronomical Society and
  Astronomical Society of the Pacific, two of astronomy's highest honors. In
  1997, the Royal Astronomical Society awarded him its Gold Medal, its highest
  honor, seldom given to an American astronomer. He was a member of the National
  Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the
  American Philosophical Society. He received honorary D.Sc. degrees from five
  universities. Over the years, Don produced 21 Ph.D. students who turned out a
  significant number of today's researchers in AGN and emission line
  studies.</p>

  <p>Mostly after his retirement in 1992, Don authored numerous books,
  historical studies, and biographies of key figures in 19th- and 20th-century
  astronomy. He felt that history was too important to be left to historians,
  and adhered to the ``great man'' theory of history (that aims to explain
  history by the impact of great men or women) rather than pursue the
  deconstructionist approach of historians. In recognition for this work, the
  AAS's Historical Astronomy Division awarded him in 2002 the Leroy E. Doggett
  Prize, the highest award given to a historian of astronomy.</p>

  <p>Don was a brilliant scientist, a natural leader, and a gifted historian,
  yet he was also very modest and unassuming. His firm handshake, warm,
  infectious smile, and congenial personality were hard to resist. He thrived in
  the companies of his colleagues and students, freely sharing his ideas on
  science, history of science, or history in general. In his later years, he
  seemed at his best when observing on top of Mount Hamilton's Lick Observatory,
  once the Sun had set and the photons from an AGN were quietly and effortlessly
  being captured for the next exposure. He would then often kick back on ``his''
  La-Z-Boy recliner in the 120-inch telescope control room and take off on one
  of his many fascinating stories about the history of astronomy. These were
  truly wonderful moments, and many of us are very grateful to have had the
  opportunity to share them with him.</p>

  <p>Don will always have a very special place in our hearts. He was a great
  mentor, a wonderful role model, and a true gentleman. Our very fond memories
  of our time with him will never cease to inspire us. He will always be an
  Ideal to which to aspire.</p>
