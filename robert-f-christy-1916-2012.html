<div>
  <p>Robert F. Christy was unique and remarkable in many ways.</p>

  <p>He was born May 14, 1916, and grew up as an orphan in Vancouver, Canada. He
  received the Governor General's Gold Medal as the top high school student in
  the province of British Columbia; this medal included a scholarship that
  enabled him to attend the University of British Columbia as an undergraduate.
  Thereafter, he stood out as a graduate student of Oppenheimer's in theoretical
  physics at Berkeley.</p>

  <p>Robert Christy was one of the pioneers invited to join the Manhattan
  Project at the University of Chicago in early1942, working on the world's
  first nuclear reactor (Chicago Pile 1). He worked first on the theoretical
  design with Eugene Wigner, and then on the experimental design with Enrico
  Fermi. This culminated in the first successful nuclear reactor on December 2,
  1942. After that, Oppenheimer invited him to be one of the first to go to the
  Los Alamos site of the Manhattan Project and work on designing the atomic
  bomb. (This was early in 1943, and no housing yet existed at Los Alamos;
  accommodation was in a nearby Indian village, with transport by bus each day
  to the laboratory, until eventually housing was constructed.) At Los Alamos,
  Robert Christy was assigned to work for Hans Bethe, who was in charge of the
  theoretical design, but he also crossed over to the experimental design team
  of Bob Bacher, where he later jokingly stated that his height (6' 5”) was
  useful when making adjustments on the bomb. The first atomic bomb was called
  the “Christy Gadget” because he had made a crucial contribution to its design,
  realizing that the plutonium implosion bomb did not need a hollow sphere that
  might crumple (and thus fizzle) when imploded, but could be designed using a
  solid sphere of plutonium. When the first atomic bomb was exploded on July 16,
  1945, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, the immediate reaction was joy that their
  work had not been in vain. Brigadier­general Thomas Farrell turned to his
  immediate superior General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project,
  and said, “The war is over.” Groves replied, “Yes, just as soon as we drop one
  or two of these things on Japan.” President Truman had little choice but to
  use the bomb on Japan: the war was so bitter that he might have been impeached
  if he had not done so. Soon, however, the scientists also began to fear for
  the consequences of this powerful new weapon.</p>

  <p>In December of 1945, Robert Christy become one of the founding members of
  the Association of Los Alamos Scientists (ALAS), and helped draft a statement
  educating the public on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. He was also one of
  the ten Caltech scientists who had worked on the atomic bomb who signed and
  paid for a full­page ad in the Los Angeles Times on Oct 14, 1956, calling for
  an end to nuclear weapons tests. In 1966, Prof. J. R. Zacharias of the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology invited Robert Christy to join a panel
  discussing technological means to end the war in Vietnam. He replied on May 4,
  1966, “I do not believe we can achieve useful ends in Vietnam by military
  means only – I am convinced the problem is much more in the political and
  diplomatic realm than the military one. ... I do not believe a solution can be
  found in technological innovations and military weapons and practices. All I
  can see in that direction is more effective killing of people with whom I
  believe we have no basic quarrel. I would almost certainly find that avenue
  one that I could not devote myself to.”</p>

  <p>Robert Christy's favorite contribution was in astrophysics, explaining for
  the first time how the RR Lyrae and Cepheid variable stars pulsated and
  changed their light output. These stars are used as key distance indicators
  for other galaxies, a crucial measuring stick needed for determining distance
  scales in the universe. In 1965, he was nominated to the National Academy of
  Sciences. In 1967, he was awarded the Eddington Gold Medal from Royal
  Astronomical society of Great Britain for his work on variable stars.</p>

  <p>One of Robert Christy's ambitions was to serve his favorite institution,
  the California Institute of Technology. He always selflessly promoted the good
  of the institution as a whole. For example, he took on a double graduate
  teaching load so that Feynman would agree to come as a professor to Caltech.
  In 1968, Robert Christy started a two­year term as Caltech's Executive Officer
  in Physics. Shortly thereafter, he started a two­year term as Executive
  Officer for Physics and Chairman of the Faculty. At this time, he was also
  made chairman of the search committee to locate a new President for Caltech,
  and (after the arrival of the new President Harold Brown) chairman of the
  committee to search for a new Provost for Caltech. When none of the candidates
  would agree to become Caltech's Provost, Harold Brown asked Robert Christy to
  become Provost himself. He decided to serve Caltech's administration, in order
  to fulfill his dreams for Caltech. These dreams, that he actually fulfilled,
  included creating a better retirement plan for the faculty; encouraging the
  hiring of women faculty at Caltech (partly by eliminating the nepotism rule);
  bringing Caltech out of the red financially; improving the physical campus
  structure of Caltech (by renovating the gracious old student houses, getting
  rid of a public road that cut through the campus, obtaining funding for
  several new buildings, including laboratories, a new administration building
  to replace the demolished Throop Hall, a second swimming pool, and a second
  athletic building); and several other improvements. Robert Christy served as
  Provost (Academic Vice­President) for ten years, from 1970 to 1980; he was
  frequently Acting President for weeks at a time when Caltech President Harold
  Brown was at Helsinki promoting the SALT talks with the Soviet Union. In
  addition to his role as Provost, Robert Christy took on the job of Interim
  President of Caltech for nearly two years, from late 1976 until mid­ 1978. He
  was unique in serving in this double role, taking on both of these heavy loads
  until a permanent President could be found for Caltech. He was offered the
  Presidency of Caltech himself, but turned it down because he wished to get
  back to his beloved research.</p>

  <p>Robert returned to teaching in 1980 and tried to get into research on
  atmospheric physics and weather prediction using satellite data, but did not
  feel he was making sufficient progress in this. In 1982, he was asked to head
  the US team in a joint US­Japan dosimetry study of low­level radiation
  exposure of 100,000 people who survived the nuclear explosions in Hiroshima
  and Nagasaki. This long­term study led to new, improved standards for
  radiation exposure safety in medicine.</p>

  <p>His were rare accomplishments, not only in physics and astrophysics, but
  also as a human being. He had a rare generosity, always sharing with the
  others around him whatever financial means he had. He also stood out as an
  athlete: he swam with Fermi, rode horses with Oppenheimer, learned
  cross­country skiing from Bethe (later also becoming an avid downhill skier,
  and once obtaining a bronze pin in a timed downhill speed trial against expert
  skiers), and enjoyed playing tennis with the best Caltech tennis players. At
  age 93, he still galloped on horseback in perfect rhythm holding hands with
  Juliana, his second wife; he jumped six­foot creeks on that horse (which his
  wife did not!).</p>

  <p>Robert Christy was married twice. His first marriage was to Dagmar von
  Lieven in May 1941, as soon as he had obtained his Ph.D. They had two sons,
  Ted and Peter. This marriage ended in an unusually friendly divorce: they
  separated in the late 1960's, and the divorce was finalized in January 1971.
  He married Inge­Juliana Sackmann, in August 1973, a woman who was 26 younger
  than himself (she was an astrophysicist). They had two daughters, Ilia and
  Alexa, late in his life as he neared his 60's. These daughters have said that
  they treasured him as the best father they could have imagined, always having
  time for them.</p>

  <p>Robert Christy was also remarkable in that he never actually retired. For
  two decades, from his mid­60's to his mid­80's, he worked intensely on the
  US­Japan joint dosimetry study, traveling all over the US and Japan. For the
  next few years, he helped his wife Juliana fight invasive cancer,
  successfully. From 2005 to 2010, he also underwent four successful surgeries
  (removal of one kidney, intestinal surgery, eye surgery, and back surgery). In
  early 2011, when he was 94, he started a scientific collaboration with Juliana
  and with Arnold Boothroyd, to resolve some remaining problems with pulsating
  stars. He also wanted to work with Arnold Boothroyd to put the finishing
  touches on a paper on basic nuclear physics that he had worked on earlier.
  These projects were never completed.</p>

  <p>Robert led a happy and fulfilling life until October 3, 2012. At the age of
  96 he passed on painlessly in his master bedroom, smiling, while being kissed
  on the cheeks by his wife Juliana and daughter Ilia. The cause of death was
  aspiration of the lungs (brought on by atrophy of his muscles).</p>

  <p>He was unique in everything that he touched while on earth. As a physicist
  and astrophysicist he was brilliant, though he was remarkable in his modesty,
  taking his innovations and discoveries for granted. As an administrator, he
  took on challenging tasks, and generated long­lasting improvements. As a
  person, he stood out for his integrity, selflessness, and generosity. He was
  tall and handsome, full of youthful energy and joie­de­vivre, be it in
  singing, in ballroom dancing, in athletic pursuits (such as hiking, swimming,
  tennis, skiing, and horse­back riding), or in his love of travel to distant
  places far off the beaten track. He was always totally involved and devoted as
  a husband, as a father, or as a friend.</p>
