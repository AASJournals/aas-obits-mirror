      <h1>Arvydas J. Kliore (1935-2014)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>It is with great sadness that we report the loss of our colleague, Dr.
  Arvydas Kliore, who died suddenly on December 7, 2014 of natural causes. Arv
  was born in Lithuania and immigrated to the United States in 1949. He joined
  the engineering staff at JPL in 1962, where he had a distinguished career for
  over half a century with numerous publications and awards. A JPL Senior
  Research Scientist for more than 25 years, he was a pioneer in planetary radio
  science, especially in the study of planetary atmospheres and ionospheres,
  beginning with the first NASA planetary mission. Arv was a
  principalinvestigator or team member on every Mariner mission, on Pioneer
  10/11, and on Pioneer Venus, and he served as Deputy Team Leader for the
  Galileo Radio Propagation Science Team. Most recently, he was a member of the
  Cassini Radio Science Team from 1990, serving as team leader for more than 20
  years. Over his career, Arv attended nearly every DPS meeting in its 47-year
  history, a testament to his remarkable level of dedication and commitment to
  the community of planetary scientists.</p>

  <p>Arv set high standards for scientific achievement, generosity, modesty,
  personal integrity, and an infectious enthusiasm for life. Those of us who had
  the privilege of working with him for decades have benefited from his wisdom,
  fairness, sense of perspective grounded in long experience, and unstinting
  loyalty and support. We miss him greatly, and will carry his memory and many
  contributions with us.</p>

  <p><em>- Dick French, on behalf of the Cassini Radio Science Team</em>
