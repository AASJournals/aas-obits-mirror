  <p>The scientific community lost Dr. Albert Paul Linnell on 20 January 2017
  after a long and successful astronomical career that spanned 68 of his 94
  years. Born in Canby, Minnesota, on 30 June 1922, Albert's family moved to
  Michigan two years later, and he spent his childhood first in Boyne City and
  then in Petoskey, the city known for its fossil stones of which Al kept his
  personal supply. After graduation from Petoskey High School in 1940, he went
  on to graduate Phi Beta Kappa from the College of Wooster in Ohio in 1944 with
  bachelor’s degrees in Physics, Chemistry, and Math. Following enlistment in
  the US Army during World War II, he served as a Lieutenant in the Signal Corps
  for 3 years in the Philippines.</p>

  <p>After the war, Al resumed his education, attending graduate school at
  Harvard University and completing his PhD in Astronomy in 1950 with his thesis
  titled "Astronomical Photoelectric Photometry." Applying photometry to close
  binary star systems, Al began what would be a lifetime of achievements in
  astronomy. His first paper, on the cataclysmic variable UX Ursae Majoris, was
  published in <i>Sky and Telescope</i> in 1949. Almost 60 years later, in 2008,
  he was still working on understanding this system, publishing a paper with
  several co-authors in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> titled "Modeling UX
  Ursae Majoris: An Abundance of Challenges." Two of the paper’s co-authors,
  Ivan Hubeny and Paula Szkody, were privileged to work with Albert on modeling
  cataclysmic variables for the last 20-30 years.</p>

  <p>One of Al's major achievements was the publicly available program that he
  developed called BINSYN, which is used to simulate the spectra and light
  curves of binary systems. Al published his final version in the
  <i>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</i> in 2012.
  Beginning in 1993, Ivan Hubeny would spend a week or two each year working
  with Al to update BINSYN. Ivan writes:</p>

  <p>"Our first project was to upgrade BINSYN from providing synthetic colors of
  a binary system, to computing a detailed synthetic spectrum by attaching
  specific model atmospheres and appropriate synthetic spectra to individual
  positions of the stellar surfaces. Mutual occultations, as well as
  non-spherical shapes of the stars were taken into account. Later, the program
  was further upgraded by including an accretion disk. We first applied this
  program to study the popular binary system Beta Lyrae, but the main subsequent
  collaborations were on cataclysmic variable systems. Computing one global
  synthetic spectrum of a cataclysmic variable system entails computing several
  model atmospheres and synthetic spectra for the central white dwarf, and about
  50 models of the vertical structure of the individual disk rings, i.e., a lot
  of work. Al did these calculations tirelessly, and with unquenchable
  enthusiasm."</p>

  <p>Paula Szkody often provided optical and ultraviolet observational data that
  Al and Ivan could model with BINSYN. Al would arrive at the University of
  Washington each week with hundreds of models revealing his latest work. In
  addition to his research work, Al was very involved in his teaching and
  administrative posts. As Professor of Astronomy at Amherst College from 1949
  to 1966, he organized Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and the University of
  Massachusetts to create a four-college astronomy department which he then
  chaired. He served on the Goldberg panel in 1953 that proposed a national
  observatory at Kitt Peak and also on a panel in 1960 that selected the site
  for Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.</p>

  <p>In 1966, Al moved back to Michigan to start the Astronomy/Astrophysics
  Department at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing and become its
  Chair. He introduced an undergraduate major in 1967 and oversaw the building
  of a campus observatory with a 24-inch Boller and Chivens reflector telescope
  that was dedicated in 1971. In the five years since its founding, the
  department grew to 50 undergraduate astrophysics majors; his later colleague,
  Paula Szkody, was one of the first graduating astrophysics majors in 1970.
  After his 25-year tenure at MSU, Albert retired and moved to Seattle in 1991
  where he became a Visiting Scholar at the University of Washington (UW) and a
  Fellow of the AAAS.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 2012, several colleagues and family gathered at UW for a
  scientific meeting to celebrate Al's 90th birthday. Throughout his scientific
  career, Al was known for his personable, upbeat attitude facing, not only
  astronomical challenges, but also personal ones with aging health situations.
  Nothing was able to erase the constant smile and intense interest in his work.
  He was also able to combine a happy family life with his research and
  administrative work. He married his college sweetheart, Jane Elliott, in 1944
  and they had five children. After Jane died in 1991, Al married a fellow
  professor at MSU, Ann Schnatterly Kremer, who also had five children. Al and
  Ann had offices in a home that had an expansive view of Lake Washington and
  Mt. Rainier, until they moved downtown in 2009 to be closer to health
  services. Al continued his research there and maintained an active interest in
  astronomy as well as good times with his extended family. Their memories
  include slide shows by Al of what life was like during his earlier years. He
  will be missed by his scientific colleagues as well as his 10 children and 20
  grandchildren. His longtime colleague, Ivan Hubeny, expressed the sentiments
  of many: "I have always deeply admired his dedication to work, and his
  inexhaustible enthusiasm to engage in research. He has become a sort of role
  model to me about how to continue in valuable scientific work well past
  retirement. He will be sorely missed by many of us, but he will always be
  remembered in our hearts."</p>
