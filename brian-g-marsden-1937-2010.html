  <p>Brian Geoffrey Marsden was born on 1937 August 5 in Cambridge, England. His
  father, Thomas, was the senior mathematics teacher at a local high school. It
  was his mother, Eileen (nee West), however, who introduced him to the study of
  astronomy, when he returned home on the Thursday during his first week in
  primary school in 1942 and found her sitting in the back yard watching an
  eclipse of the sun. Using now frowned-upon candle-smoked glass, they sat
  watching the changing bite out of the sun. What most impressed the budding
  astronomer, however, was not that the eclipse could be seen, but the fact that
  it had been predicted in advance, and it was the idea that one could make
  successful predictions of events in the sky that eventually led him to his
  career.</p>

  <p>When, at the age of 11, he entered the Perse School in Cambridge he was
  developing primitive methods for calculating the positions of the planets. He
  soon realized that earlier astronomers had come up with more accurate
  procedures for doing this over the centuries, and during the next couple of
  years this led to his introduction to the library of the Cambridge University
  Observatories and his study of how eclipses, for example, could be precisely
  computed. Together with a couple of other students he formed a school
  Astronomical Society, of which he served as the secretary. At the age of 16 he
  joined and began regularly attending the monthly London meetings of the
  British Astronomical Association. He quickly became involved with the
  Association's Computing Section, which was known specifically for making
  astronomical predictions other than those that were routinely being prepared
  by professional astronomers for publication in almanacs around the world.
  Under the watchful eyes of the director and assistant director of the
  Computing Section, this led him to prepare and publish predictions of the
  occasions when one of Jupiter's moons could be seen to pass directly in front
  of another. He also calculated the gravitational effects of the planets on the
  dates and sky positions of the returns of some periodic comets. He carried out
  these computations using seven-place logarithms. After all, this was long
  before pocket calculators had been invented, and the construction of large
  electronic computers was still then very much in its infancy. He always
  maintained that making such computations by primitive means significantly
  increased one's understanding of the science involved. During his last year of
  high school he also became a junior member of the Royal Astronomical
  Society.</p>

  <p>He was an undergraduate at New College, University of Oxford. In his first
  year there he persuaded the British Astronomical Association to lend him a
  mechanical calculating machine, allowing him thereby to increase his
  computational productivity. By the time he received his undergraduate degree,
  in mathematics, he had already developed somewhat of an international
  reputation for the computation of orbits of comets, including new discoveries.
  He spent part of his first two undergraduate summer vacations working at the
  British Nautical Almanac Office. He also responded to an inquiry from Dorothy
  L. Sayers involving the ancient Roman poet Lucan. Incensed by what she
  perceived as grossly unfair criticism of Lucan by A. E. Housman and Robert
  Graves, she elicited his assistance during the last year of her life to
  support her view that Lucan's understanding of astronomy and geography was
  reasonably valid. Dr. Sayers' extensive correspondence in the course of this
  study is included in the last volume of her collected letters.</p>

  <p>After Oxford, he took up an invitation to cross the pond and work at the
  Yale University Observatory. He had originally planned to spend just a year
  there carrying out research on orbital mechanics, but on his arrival in 1959
  he was also enrolled as a Yale graduate student. With the ready availability
  of the university's IBM 650 computer in the observatory building, he had soon
  programmed it to compute the orbits of comets. Recalling his earlier interest
  in Jupiter's moons, he completed the requirements for his Ph.D. degree with a
  thesis on "The Motions of the Galilean Satellites of Jupiter".</p>

  <p>At the invitation of director Fred Whipple, he joined the staff of the
  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge (MA) in 1965. Dr. Whipple
  was probably best known for devising the "dirty snowball" model for the
  nucleus of a comet a decade and a half earlier. At that time there was only
  rather limited evidence that the motion of a comet was affected by forces over
  and above those of gravitation (limited because of the need to compute the
  orbit by hand), and the Whipple model had it that those forces were due to the
  comet's reaction to vaporization of the cometary snow or ice by solar
  radiation. Dr. Marsden therefore developed a way to incorporate such forces
  directly into the equations that governed the motion of a comet. Application
  of a computer program that included these nongravitational effects to several
  comets soon gave results that were nicely compatible with Dr. Whipple's
  original idea. Continued refinement of the nongravitational terms, much of it
  done in collaboration with Zdenek Sekanina, a Czech astronomer and friend of
  Dr. Marsden whom he and Dr. Whipple succeeded in bringing to the U.S. as a
  refugee following the Soviet invasion of Prague in 1968, resulted in a wealth
  of improved computations of cometary orbits by the time Dr. Sekanina moved to
  California in 1980. It is noteworthy that the procedure devised and developed
  by Dr. Marsden is still widely used to compute the nongravitational effects of
  comets, with relatively little further modification by other astronomers.</p>

  <p>The involvement of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory with comets
  had been given a boost, shortly before Dr. Marsden's arrival there, by the
  transfer there from Copenhagen of the office of the Central Bureau for
  Astronomical Telegrams, a quaintly named organization that was established by
  the International Astronomical Union soon after its founding in 1920. The CBAT
  is responsible for disseminating information worldwide about the discoveries
  of comets, novae, supernovae and other objects of generally transient
  astronomical interest. It is the CBAT that actually names the comets
  (generally for their discoverers), and it has also been a repository for the
  observations of comets to which orbit computations need to be fitted. Dr.
  Marsden succeeded Dr. Owen Gingerich as the CBAT director in 1968. He was
  joined by Daniel Green as a student assistant a decade later, and Dr. Green
  took over as CBAT director in 2000. Until the early 1980s the Bureau really
  did receive and disseminate the discovery information by telegram (with
  dissemination also by postcard Circular), although e-mail announcements then
  understandably began to take over. The last time the CBAT received a telegram
  was when Thomas Bopp sent word of his discovery of a comet in 1995. Since word
  of this same discovery had already been received from Alan Hale a few hours
  earlier by e-mail, the object was very nearly just named Comet Hale, rather
  than the famous Comet Hale-Bopp that beautifully graced the world's skies for
  several weeks two years later.</p>

  <p>The comet prediction of which he was most proud was of the return of comet
  Swift-Tuttle, which is the comet associated with the Perseid meteors each
  August. It had been discovered in 1862, and the conventional wisdom was that
  it would return around 1981. He followed that line for much of a paper he
  published on the subject in 1973. He had a strong suspicion, however, that the
  1862 comet was identical with one seen in 1737, and this assumption allowed
  him to predict that Swift-Tuttle would not return until late-1992. This
  prediction proved to be correct, and this comet has the longest orbital period
  of all the comets whose returns have been successfully predicted.</p>

  <p>Although the CBAT also traditionally made announcements of the discoveries
  of asteroids that came close to the earth, the official organization for
  attending to discoveries of asteroids (more than 99% of which are located in a
  belt between Mars and Jupiter) is the Minor Planet Center. Also operated by
  the International Astronomical Union, the MPC was located until 1978 at the
  Cincinnati Observatory. In that year the director, Dr. Paul Herget, was
  retiring, and it was necessary for the Center to find a new home. Accordingly,
  the IAU asked Dr. Marsden also to take over the direction of the MPC. Thanks
  to the transfer of associate director Conrad Bardwell with the MPC records
  from Cincinnati, this task was rendered easier. While the CBAT and the MPC
  still maintained their separate entities, there was a lot of common ground
  between them. Dr. Marsden was therefore able to introduce some efficiencies
  into their combined operation. On Mr. Bardwell's retirement at the end of
  1989, Gareth Williams joined the MPC staff and later became associate
  director.</p>

  <p>The advances in electronic communication during the 1990s also permitted
  improvements in MPC operation. Perhaps the most important of these was the
  development, in 1996, of the Internet "Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page".
  This draws attention to candidate earth-approaching objects in need of
  follow-up observations as soon as they have been reported to the MPC,
  following the derivation by Dr. Marsden of a particularly ingenious method for
  estimating the uncertainty of the prediction by automatically computing a
  series of orbits that represent just the first and the last observations. In
  1998 he developed a certain amount of notoriety by suggesting that an object
  called 1997 XF11 could collide with the earth. He did this as a last-ditch
  effort to encourage the acquisition of further observations, including
  searches for possible data from several years earlier. The recognition of some
  observations from 1990 made it quite clear that there could be no collision
  with 1997 XF11 during the foreseeable future. Without those 1990 observations,
  however, the object's orbit would have become very uncertain following a close
  to moderate approach to the earth in 2028; indeed, Dr. Marsden correctly
  demonstrated that there was the possibility of an earth impact in 2040 and in
  several neighboring years. He was thereby able eventually to persuade his
  principal critics routinely to perform similar uncertainty computations for
  all near-earth objects as they were announced. Again, as more data accrue, it
  is almost certain to happen that all possible impacts with moderately large
  objects (i.e., those at least several hundred feet across) during the next
  century, say, will disappear. While the production of such computations was
  directly due to his encouragement, it was always with some amusement that he
  saw cases where further data forced his former critics sheepishly to withdraw
  their earlier frightening statements about a potentially dangerous object.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marsden was particularly fascinated by the appearance of a group of
  comets that passed close to the sun. Known as members of the Kreutz group,
  after a German astronomer who studied them in the late nineteenth century, the
  discovery of three more of these sungrazing comets in the mid-twentieth
  century led him to undertake a detailed examination of how the individual
  comets may have evolved from each other. He published this examination in
  1967, following it up with a further study in 1989 involving a more recent
  bright Kreutz comet, as well as several much fainter objects that had been
  detected from sun-observing coronagraphs out in space. Beginning in 1996,
  these were being found by the SOHO coronagraphs at rates ranging from a few
  dozen to more than one hundred per year. Unfortunately, the faintness of the
  comets and the poor accuracy with which they could be measured made it
  difficult to establish their orbits as satisfactorily as Dr. Marsden would
  have liked. More significantly, however, he was able to recognize that the
  SOHO data also contained another group of comets with similar orbits, these
  comets now known as members of the "Marsden group". Unlike the individual
  Kreutz comets, which have orbital periods of several centuries, it seems that
  the Marsden comets have orbital periods of only five or six years, leading him
  to try and recognize the same object at different passages near the sun and
  thereby predict future returns. Two other well-populated groups have also been
  detected in the SOHO data.</p>

  <p>Another series of astronomical discoveries that greatly interested him were
  what he always called the "transneptunian objects", although many of his
  colleagues have insisted on calling them "objects in the Kuiper Belt". When
  what those same colleagues considered to be the first of these was discovered
  in 1992, Dr. Marsden immediately remarked that this was untrue, because Pluto,
  discovered in 1930 and admittedly somewhat larger in size, had to be the
  first. More specifically, he was the first to suggest, correctly, that three
  further transneptunian objects discovered in 1993 were exactly like Pluto in
  the sense that they all orbit the sun twice while Neptune orbits it thrice.
  This particular recognition set him firmly on the quest to "demote" Pluto.
  Success required the discovery of transneptunian objects more comparable to
  Pluto in size, something that finally happened in 2005 with the discovery of
  the object that came to be known as Eris. At its triennial meeting in 2006 in
  Prague, the IAU voted to designate these objects, together with two further
  transneptunian objects now known as Makemake and Haumea, as well as the
  largest asteroid, Ceres, members of a new class of "dwarf planet".</p>

  <p>It was also at the IAU meeting in Prague that Dr. Marsden stepped down as
  MPC director, and he was quite entertained by the thought that both he and
  Pluto had been retired on the same day. While he remained working at the MPC
  (and also the CBAT) in an emeritus capacity, the directorship was passed to
  Dr. Timothy Spahr, whom he had brought to the MPC in 2000.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marsden served as an associate director of the Harvard-Smithsonian
  Center for Astrophysics (the combination of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
  Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory) for 15.75 years from the
  beginning of 1987 (the longest tenure for any of the Center's associate
  directors). He was chair of the Division of Dynamical Astronomy of the
  American Astronomical Society during 1976-1978 and president of the IAU
  commissions that oversaw the operation of the minor Planet Center (1976-1979)
  and the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (2000-2003). He continued to
  serve subsequently on the two solar-system nomenclature committees of the IAU,
  being the perennial secretary of the one that decides on names for asteroids.
  He also continued to publish a "Catalogue of Cometary Orbits," the first of
  these having appeared in 1972 and its successors roughly at intervals of two
  years.</p>

  <p>Among the various awards he received from the U.S., the U.K. and a handful
  of other European countries, the ones he particularly appreciated were the
  1995 Dirk Brouwer Award (named for his mentor at Yale) of the AAS Division on
  Dynamical Astronomy and the 1989 Van Biesbroeck Award (named for an old friend
  and observer of comets and double stars), then presented by the University of
  Arizona, now by the AAS, for service to astronomy.</p>

  <p>Dr. Marsden married Nancy Lou Zissell, of Trumbull, Connecticut, on 1964
  December 26, and fathered Cynthia (who is married to Gareth Williams, still
  MPC associate director), of Arlington, Massachusetts; and Jonathan, of San
  Mateo, California. There are three Californian grandchildren, Nikhilas,
  Nathaniel and Neena. A sister, Sylvia Custerson, continues to reside in
  Cambridge, England.</p>
