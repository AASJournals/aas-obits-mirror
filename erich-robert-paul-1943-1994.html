      <h1>Erich Robert Paul (1943-1994)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Erich Robert Paul, Professor of History of Science and Computer Science at
  Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, died October 12, 1994, of cancer.
  He was most recently the author of
    <cite>
      The Milky Way Galaxy and Statistical Cosmology, 1890-1924</cite>,
      (Cambridge University Press, 1993), and an annotated translation of
      Henrietta Hertzsprung-Kapteyn's
    <cite>
      The Life and Works of J.C. Kapteyn</cite> (Kluwer, 1993). These detailed
      studies are important for an understanding of how our present view of the
      stellar universe developed.</p>
  <p>Robert was born July 23, 1943, in Los Angeles, to William B. and Caroline
  Paul. After receiving his B.S. (1966) and M.S. (1969) in Mathematics from
  Brigham Young University, he worked at Boeing and General Dynamics as an
  aerospace engineer, gaining expertise in the rapidly expanding field of
  computer science. He then set his sights on a career in history of science,
  specializing in the history of astronomy. He received his M.A (1974) and PhD
  (1976) in History and Philosophy of Science from Indiana University, under the
  guidance of Victor Thoren and Richard S. Westfall. Here he began the
  historical studies on statistical astronomy which became the central focus of
  his scholarly work.</p>

  <p>Upon graduation in 1976, Robert went to Dickinson College as an assistant
  Professor, and moved up through the ranks to Professor in 1991. From 1984 to
  1989 he also served as Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Computer
  Science. Robert was praised by students and colleagues alike for both his
  teaching and administrative abilities. He was instrumental in making history
  of science a part of the science requirement at Dickinson. Shortly before his
  death he had been named Joseph Priestley Professor of the History of
  Science.</p>

  <p>In undertaking his research, Robert frequented many archives in attempting
  to understand the relative roles of George Ellery Hale, Kapteyn and Hugo von
  Seeliger, among other astronomers central to the rise of statistical
  astronomy. Grants from the National Science Foundation and the National
  Endowment for the Humanities for this research testify to the high opinion of
  his peers.</p>

  <p>Although comfortable with the technical aspects of history of astronomy,
  Robert was also interested in much broader issues, including the relation
  between science and religion. A devoted Mormon, he was also the author of
    <cite>
      Science, Religion and Mormon Cosmology</cite> (University of Illinois
      Press, 1992). Above all, he was devoted to his family, with whom he
      enjoyed skiing, music and the joys of everyday life. He is survived by his
      wife Kathleen, and five children: Ann-Marie, Lisa, Juliet, Erica and
      Christopher.</p>
  <p>Robert was a member of the History of Science Society and the Historical
  Astronomy Division of the American Astronomical Society. He was always a
  thoughtful and helpful colleague, as well as a careful scholar and a good
  friend. Our field will be diminished by his untimely death.</p>
