  <p>Known to his astronomical colleagues simply as 'Vis', Natarajan Visvanathan
  enjoyed their deep affection and esteem throughout his full and productive
  career. He was born on 23 February 1932 in Sankarankoil, Madras, India. His
  father, Natarajan Iyer was a criminal lawyer while his mother, Gangai Ammal
  was a housewife. In the year prior to Vis’s birth, his parents lost seven of
  his older siblings in a cholera epidemic. Vis was a precocious student and
  excelled in mathematics and Carnatic music. After completing a BSc in 1952 at
  Madras University in Thiruchi, he took some additional meteorological training
  and then joined the staff of the Kodaikanal observatory where he worked as a
  research assistant to Vainu Bappu.</p>

  <p>Vis's association with Mount Stromlo spanned two phases—first as a graduate
  student in the early 1960s, and later as a staff member until his retirement
  in 1997. Recruited by Stromlo’s Director, Bart Bok, Vis first came to Mount
  Stromlo to undertake his PhD studies in 1962. Bok had a passion for working
  with students, and an urgent desire to establish a world-class graduate school
  at Stromlo. Right from the start, Bok wanted his program to be international
  in composition and ethos, so he contacted colleagues around the world
  persuading them to act as his recruiting agents. Bappu, a former student of
  Bok's at Harvard, recommended Vis to Bok as a young scientist of the caliber
  he was seeking. Vis was among the first dozen students whom Bok appointed.</p>

  <p>Vis chose as his area of thesis research the technically demanding field of
  polarimetry. This involves using special filters at the telescope to
  investigate how the light from individual stars has been affected by the
  presence of magnetic fields and dust particles on its long journey through
  space. In 1965 Vis submitted a thesis entitled “Polarization in the Galaxy and
  the Large Magellanic Cloud,” and graduated with his PhD in May of the
  following year.</p>

  <p>In 1966, Vis went to Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories in California
  as a Carnegie Fellow. With his experience in polarimetry, he used the large
  telescopes there to make polarization observations of radio galaxies. He
  showed for the first time that the optical light from some of these objects
  does not come from stars; it is primarily synchrotron radiation emitted by
  electrons moving in a magnetic field.</p>

  <p>While in California, Vis began a long and productive collaboration with
  Allan Sandage. Together they did a memorable polarization study of the
  filaments in the starbursting galaxy M82. They showed that the light of these
  filaments is polarized because it comes from the hidden inner regions and is
  scattered by dust. This was a novel and influential idea. From 1968 to 1972,
  Vis was a Research Associate and Lecturer at Harvard, returning to the Hale
  Observatories and California Institute of Technology as a Visiting Associate
  from 1972 to 1975.</p>

  <p>In 1975, Vis returned to the Mount Stromlo as a staff member. The
  observatory became his career home for the rest of his working life. Here his
  interests moved to galaxy photometry, the field that made him famous. The
  colors of galaxies depend on how bright the galaxies are: very bright galaxies
  are systematically redder, because their stars have different chemical
  properties from those in the fainter galaxies. This is called the
  color-luminosity (C-L) relation for galaxies. It seems to be a universal
  relation, the same everywhere in the nearby universe. Vis developed the
  techniques to measure the C-L relation precisely, and acquired his
  well-deserved reputation as one of the few people in the world who could do
  precise and reliable photometry of galaxies.</p>

  <p>The high point of Vis's work on galaxy colors came in a series of very
  influential papers with Sandage in the late 1970s, on the C-L relation for
  elliptical and S0 galaxies. These papers are still much cited, with more than
  200 references for each paper in the series. One can use the C-L relation to
  measure the distances to galaxies, and in this way to estimate the elusive
  Hubble constant that, in turn, tells us how fast the Universe is expanding,
  thus yielding an estimate for its age. In the late 1970s, there was
  considerable controversy about the value of the Hubble constant. It was a
  stormy time in extragalactic astronomy. Vis used his observations to derive a
  value that disagreed with the value favored by most other workers at the time.
  He had the courage to stand by what his data were telling him. Now, twenty
  years later, we think we know the true value of Hubble's constant, and it
  turns out that the result that Vis obtained was very close to the current
  estimate.</p>

  <p>Although Vis will be remembered particularly for his work on galaxy
  photometry, he had other research interests, deriving from his photometric
  skills. Two stand out:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>With Don Mathewson and Vince Ford, Vis made an exciting study of the
    Small Magellanic Cloud, which showed that it is being ripped apart by its
    interaction with the neighboring Large Cloud</li>
    <li>Vis had a long interest in a kind of magnetized variable star called AM
    Herculis objects—these show some dramatic changes that can be studied well
    with the photometric techniques that Vis was expert in. With Dayal
    Wickramasinghe and others, Vis published several papers about these
    stars.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Vis was an enthusiastic researcher and passed his enthusiasm on to his PhD
  students - David Griersmith, Andrew Pickles, Glen Mackie, and Anya Schroeder.
  We shall miss Vis, and we shall remember him.</p>

  <p>In 1961, Vis married Gomathi and the couple had one son, Kumar, and two
  daughters, Kala and Sudha. All three children obtained graduate degrees and
  are practicing in various biological or medical fields. We sympathize with his
  family in their sad loss when Vis died suddenly, while swimming at Stradbroke
  Island on 3 August 2001.</p>
