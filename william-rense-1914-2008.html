      <h1>William A. Rense (1914-2008)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>On March 28, 2008, the space research community lost another of its
  pioneers. William A. Rense, professor emeritus of physics at the University of
  Colorado in Boulder, who died in Estes Park, Colorado, following complications
  from cancer. He was 94. Bill, as he was widely known, was born in 1914 in
  Massillon, Ohio, the son of German immigrants. His was a large family - five
  brothers and one sister. His father, Joseph Rense, worked for the city of
  Cleveland while his mother, Rosalia (Luther) Rense was a housewife.</p>

  <p>As a child, Bill developed a love of astronomy which led him to earn a
  bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy from Case Western Reserve
  University in Cleveland, followed by master's and PhD degrees in physics at
  Ohio State University. He held teaching positions at Rutgers, University of
  Miami (Florida), Texas A &amp; M, and Louisiana State University before taking
  his final appointment at CU in 1949. While teaching at LSU, he met and in 1942
  married Wanda (Childs) Rense.</p>

  <p>In addition to teaching physics at CU, Bill did research in CU's Upper Air
  Laboratory. His early work there included studies of polarized light and its
  implications for the analysis of zodiacal light. He and his co-workers also
  began developing instrumentation to be flown above the Earth's atmosphere in
  sounding rockets. In 1952 he obtained the first photographic spectrogram of
  the solar Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen (121.6nm).</p>

  <p>This work was followed in 1956 by the first full disk spectroheliogram in
  Lyman-alpha. These results could not have been possible without the use of
  pointing control systems for sounding rockets. These "sun trackers" kept the
  payloads pointed at the sun long enough for the measurements to be made, and
  CU was a pioneer in their development.</p>

  <p>The expanding research venue led the Upper Air Laboratory to be renamed the
  Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), and Bill Rense was its
  first director. He continued his research into the properties of the solar
  atmosphere with high resolution observations of He I and He II (58.4 and 30.4
  nm) and O I (130.5nm), as well as terrestrial atmospheric absorption
  measurements, utilizing the sun as an Extreme Ultraviolet source. In the
  meantime, the pointing control business proved to be so popular that it was
  transferred to a then-small local business owned by Ball Brothers Research
  Corporation. It is now the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation.</p>

  <p>Bill retired from CU in 1980. He had a successful and productive career at
  LASP, but teaching was his first love. Besides teaching undergraduates, he
  trained graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the latest research
  techniques. His family recalls the joy he took in teaching honors classes at
  their home in Boulder as well as the many letters he received from the
  students he inspired. He had a constantly enquiring mind and loved to share
  his curiosity with others, whether the subject was beat frequencies heard on a
  jet plane or stellar constellations seen from Estes Park.</p>

  <p>Bill was a devoted amateur naturalist and kept detailed records of the
  weather and of the first appearances of birds and flowers observed at his
  summer cabin in Allenspark, Colorado. One of his earliest publications
  concerned the nighttime observation of migrating birds, seen as they flew in
  front of the moon. It is a technique employed by birders as far back as 1902
  and still used today. Working in collaboration with George H. Lowery, Curator
  of the Museum of Zoology at LSU, Bill established the observational ground
  rules that would enable ornithologists to determine the compass heading,
  altitude and density of birds along their nocturnal flyways.</p>

  <p>When people are asked what Bill Rense was like, a word that frequently
  comes up is "courtly". In all his transactions with other people, Bill was
  unfailingly soft spoken and gracious. When confronted with a profoundly bad
  idea, his typical response would be to say, "Well - that's different." In a
  field sometimes dominated by large egos, his unassuming manner may have been
  what made him stand out as a teacher and as a friend. A quote from Alexander
  Pope seems to fit him: "True politeness consists in being easy one's self, and
  in making everyone about one as easy as one can.</p>

  <p>William A. Rense is survived by his wife, Wanda Rense of Estes Park,
  Colorado, and three sons: William of Estes Park, John of Anchorage, Alaska,
  and Charles of Los Alamos, New Mexico. A memorial service was held on April 2,
  2008, at Good Samaritan Village, Estes Park.</p>
