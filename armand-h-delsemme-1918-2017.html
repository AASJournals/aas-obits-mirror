  <p>Armand H. Delsemme, Professor Emeritus of Physics and Astronomy at the
  University of Toledo, passed away on Saturday. July 22, 2017. He was 99 years
  old. Armand Delsemme was born in Verviers, Belgium, on February 1, 1918. He
  was interested in science, and especially astronomy, from a young age.
  Physics, chemistry, and astronomy were never far from the various twists and
  turns of his life. Armand started his formal scientific education at the
  University of Liège, Belgium, from 1936 to 1940, where he studied molecular
  spectroscopy, with the goal of becoming an astronomer. While still a student
  at the University, he founded the Astronomical Society of Liège (SAL), which
  still exists today with nearly 600 members. His Master's thesis on the FeO
  spectrum was submitted, despite delays and uncertainty resulting from the
  invasion of Belgium in the early part of World War II.</p>

  <p>During the war he was a member of the Belgian resistance movement,
  collecting information about the locations and wavelength of the first German
  radar stations in Belgium, which was radioed back to London in coded messages.
  Because of his efforts, he was eventually sought by the Gestapo and escaped
  through France and into Spain, where he was captured and spent a year in the
  Miranda de Ebro Concentration Camp. He was subsequently released in an Allied
  trade of Belgian prisoners for Canadian grain. The released prisoners traveled
  through Portugal and eventually to England. After convincing the British that
  he was not a spy and that he actually worked for the Belgian resistance, he
  was recruited to work with the British Secret Service, MI6, learned to
  parachute, and was parachuted back into France for a mission. During his time
  in England he met Gladys Arrowsmith. They married, moved back to Belgium after
  the war, and had three children. Tragically, Gladys passed away when the
  children were still quite young. In 1956 he married Delphine Jehoulet, an
  astronomer in her own right in Liège, who had completed research for her Ph.D.
  after working for a year in the US at several observatories, but sadly never
  completed her thesis.</p>

  <p>After the war Armand returned to Belgium to work full time as a researcher
  for l'Azote and pursued a Ph.D. in molecular spectroscopy at the University of
  Liège. It was at this time that Professor Pol Swings (well known for the
  "Swings Effect" among many other discoveries) had shown him one of the then
  recent and now famous papers by Fred Whipple on the nature of comets. This was
  the time (1949-1952) of the great revolution in our understanding comets. In
  addition to Whipple's papers there was the paper of Jan Oort on the origin of
  cometary orbits and the paper by Ludwig Biermann suggesting a high-speed solar
  wind was responsible for cometary ion tails. After reading Whipple's paper,
  Armand realized that the activity of comets could not be explained by the
  sublimation of the kinds of ices like methane, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia
  discussed by Whipple because the sublimation temperatures were far too low. He
  had some experience with clathrate hydrates and realized that it was possible
  to trap a substantial fraction of supervolatiles in a water ice matrix that
  would behave thermodynamically essentially like water. As a result he then
  published his seminal paper, Delsemme and Swings (1952), which showed that
  comet activity was dominated by a large fraction of water ice.</p>

  <p>After his Ph.D. he remained working as a researcher in Belgium until 1956.
  From 1956-1958 he directed the building of the Institute for Scientific
  Research in Central Africa (IRSAC) optical telescope in the Congo, Africa.
  While in Africa he was asked to participate in a geological expedition to the
  Nyiragongo volcano for which he constructed a field spectrometer to record the
  first spectra of volcanic gas flames emanating from a vent within the volcano
  crater. He returned to Europe and then worked in science administration in
  Paris, France, from 1960-1966 as the head of Basic Scientific Research at the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), working on
  international cooperation. In 1965 he began to return again to comet research.
  In 1966 he accepted a professorship at the University of Toledo, where he was
  the first astronomer in what had been a Physics department. One of his first
  duties was to direct the completion of a new observatory on campus that
  consisted of a 40-inch Cassegrain telescope, which has been used for stellar
  and cometary spectroscopy since then.</p>

  <p>During his scientific career at the University of Toledo, he made early
  important contributions to virtually every sub-discipline of cometary
  research, including nucleus activity, cometary orbital origin studies,
  laboratory studies of ices, the dynamics and appearance of gas and dust in the
  coma, and comet compositional chemistry and its connections to interstellar
  matter, the origin of the solar system and the volatile content of the Earth
  and life. Professionally he served as President and Vice-President of
  Commission 15, Physical Study of Comets and Minor Planets of the International
  Astronomical Society. He organized and edited the book following the first
  Comets-Asteroid-Meteorites conference in Uppsala, Sweden, which led to the
  ongoing Asteroids, Comets and Meteors Conference series. Armand was selected
  to serve as an Interdisciplinary Scientist for NASA's Comet Rendezvous
  Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission in 1986 that was unfortunately cancelled just
  after its official new start in 1992.</p>

  <p>For his lifetime contributions to cometary and planetary science Armand was
  awarded the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize in 1998 by the Division for Planetary
  Sciences of the American Astronomical Society. He was also awarded the Jules
  Janssen Prize of the Astronomical Society of France (SAF). Asteroids Delsemme
  (2954) and Delphine (3218) were named after Armand and his wife Delphine. In
  1994 he published his book, "Our Cosmic Origins" in French, that was later
  published in English in 1998. Armand Delsemme continued working and writing
  well into his 80s. He is survived by 3 children, 2 in the US and 1 in Belgium,
  4 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.</p>

  <p>Personal note from the author: Armand Delsemme was my Ph.D. thesis advisor
  at the University of Toledo in the 1970s. His unbridled enthusiasm in
  everything he did combined with his research at the time on many of the
  fundamental issues of cometary science attracted me as a young graduate
  student. Every year or two, he and his wife, Delphine, would host a reception
  at their house for the department faculty, staff, and grad students. A few
  times he would show his impressive home movie of his expedition to the volcano
  Nyiragongo. After climbing down 180 meters from the volcano rim, he was
  lowered by cable in a parachute-like harness to the inner terrace 180 meters
  below that and just above the lava lake, where he made his spectroscopic
  measurements. As the film showed him being lowered by crane inside the
  volcano, he was seen smiling and waving at the camera. He would narrate the
  movie with "You see I am smiling, but I was not very happy!" At such
  gatherings he would also tell us about his exploits in the Belgian resistance
  and his year in the Spanish prison camp, where the prisoners were able to
  barter goods with the guards like chocolate that they were given by the
  International Red Cross. He was able to construct a makeshift camera and
  bartered with the guards for a roll of film. Once he was released he was able
  to get the film developed and amazingly had pictures of himself while a
  prisoner in the camp. One of my favorite anecdotes of those times was when he
  described how his release came from a trade of prisoners for Allied grain, and
  his wife, Delphine, would tease him, telling him all he was worth was a sack
  of flour. Clearly the value of his amazing adventure-filled life and his
  fundamental scientific accomplishments must not be underestimated.</p>
