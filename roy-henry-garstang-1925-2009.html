  <p>Roy Henry Garstang 84 passed away on November 1, 2009 in Boulder Colorado.
  He was born in Southport, England in September of 1925 to Percy Brocklehurst
  and Eunice (Gledhill) Garstang. He won a scholarship to Caius College in
  Cambridge University. Because it was wartime, he could spend only two years at
  his studies. However, he managed to complete three years of required work
  during that time, and then spent 1945-46 as a Junior Scientific Officer at the
  Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. He received his BA in 1946 from
  Cambridge, his MA in 1950, and his PhD in Mathematics in 1954, with a thesis:
  “Atomic Transitions in Astrophysics,” working under D. R. Hartree. He also
  received a ScD from Cambridge in Physics and Chemistry in 1983. He married Ann
  in August 1959. She and two daughters, Jennifer and Susan, survive him.</p>

  <p>While still pursuing his PhD, Roy Garstang served as a Research Associate
  at the Yerkes Observatory, from 1951–1952, working under Subrahmanyan
  Chandrasekhar. During that time he continued with his own calculations of
  atomic structure and transition probabilities, although these were not part of
  Chandra’s research interests. After earning his PhD, he went to teach at the
  University of London, where he also served as the Assistant Director of the
  University of London Observatory (1959-1964). He was editor of “The
  Observatory” Magazine form 1953-1960.</p>

  <p>The continuing theme of this research was to help meet the needs of
  astrophysicists for atomic data. In 1964, he left England for the United
  States, where he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
  where he would remain for the rest of his professional career. It was entirely
  fitting, considering his interest in performing calculations of interest to
  astrophysicists, that soon after arriving in Boulder he was appointed Chairman
  of JILA - Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (1966-1967). He was
  Director of the Division of Physics and AstroGeophysics (1979-80), acting
  Director of the Fiske Planetarium (1980-81), Chair of the Faculty Assembly
  (1988-1989) and recipient of the Faculty Assembly Excellence in Service Award
  in 1990. During his career Garstang was active in a number of professional
  organizations, including the British Astronomical Association (two-term Vice
  President) and Sigma Xi for which he was the Secretary of the University of
  Colorado for 20 years. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the
  Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society the American Physical
  Society, the Optical Society of America, the Royal Astronomical Society, the
  Institute of Physics (British), the Royal Statistical Society, and the
  Cambridge Philosophical Society. He published more than 150 articles in
  scientific journals.</p>

  <p>Roy Garstang was the consummate resource for atomic calculations needed by
  the astrophysical community. His first scientific paper published when he was
  a graduate student in 1950 was “Some line strengths for ionized neon” (Monthly
  Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 110: 612-614) and some 55 papers
  later, in 1981 he published calculations on neutral technetium “Oscillator
  strengths for neutral technetium” (PASP 93:641. 1981). A continuing interest
  of his was forbidden transitions, such as are important in the solar corona,
  aurora, planetary nebula, and nova shells. He made important calculations of
  the energy levels and spectra of highly ionized species of iron and worked
  extensively on magnetic quadrupole radiation, which proved to be important in
  the solar corona. Garstang also studied the effects of strong magnetic field
  on atomic spectra, ranging from the thousand gauss fields of sunspots to
  megagauss fields of white dwarfs.</p>

  <p>He was internationally recognized for his work on light pollution, which
  turned into a major course change for him, becoming his primary research
  interest after 1984. Between 1984 and 2007, he published 40 scientific papers
  of which 37 concerned sky brightness in one way or another. He constructed and
  modified a light pollution model (Dust and Light Pollution, PASP 103:1109
  (1991)) which included an ozone layer, scattering of light by molecules and
  aerosols with improved variations with altitude, curvature of the earth, and a
  dust layer of dust either volcanic or desert origin. His models have become
  the standard for the field and have successfully reproduced the variation of
  sky glow with position in the sky and with distance from light sources. His
  models raised awareness of the factors contributing to light pollution at
  observatory sites and led to efforts to reduce urban light pollution.</p>

  <p>Garstang played an important role in the teaching program of the CU Bolder
  Astrophysics and Planetary Science department, teaching large introductory
  classes, laboratory and observatory sessions as well as upper division classes
  and graduate classes. His appetite for teaching undergraduate can be
  appreciated by some of the laboratory exercise he invented such as measuring
  the solar constant by the rate of rise of temperature inside closed car (“How
  hot does your parked car become?” AAPT Announce 18:139 (1988)).</p>

  <p>In 1994 he published a letter in <em>AmJPh</em> about a continuing
  discussion of SI units. The letter reveals much about his approach to life and
  physics.</p>

  <p>“I have done a lot of work during the last 15 years on light pollution. If
  you want to reach lighting engineers you have to talk about lumens, lux,
  foot-candles, and whatever. If you do not, your reward is simply not to be
  understood. Photons per square meter per second per steradian means nothing to
  them. The problem is doubly compounded because astronomers have their own
  traditional units, such as number of tenth magnitude stars per square degree,
  magnitudes per square arc second, and so on, which are equally obscure to the
  engineering community. By all means work in metric, but be prepared to quote
  your main results in language understood by the consumers of your results. In
  fact, a little common sense is what we need.”</p>
