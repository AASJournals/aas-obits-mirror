  <p>Lee Will Simon, an astronomer by education, and a planetarium administrator
  by profession, was born on 18 February 1940 in Evanston, Illinois. He was the
  son of Clarence T. Simon, a professor of speech pathology at Northwestern
  University, and Dorothy née Will Simon, a homemaker, drama coach and published
  poet. Simon earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics (1962), a Master's
  degree in Astronomy (1964), and a Doctorate in Astronomy (1972), all from
  Northwestern University. His doctoral dissertation was on the spectroscopy of
  long-period variable stars. In 1969, Simon joined the Astronomy
  Department at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago where he led the exhibit
  development and sky show production efforts. Although he was a consummate
  lecturer, Simon gradually converted the staff from live to taped sky shows in
  the mid-1970s. He was the Adler’s Program Supervisor for nearly ten years
  before being appointed Morrison Planetarium director at the California Academy
  of Sciences in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Simon arrived at Morrison Planetarium in January of 1977 and immediately
  set about making changes. He succeeded Captain Robert Risser, who had led the
  planetarium for ten years and had established a substantial improvement fund.
  This fund allowed for some major upgrades to the planetarium theater,
  including a renovation of seats and carpeting and a modernization of the
  theater's electronic controls. Simon formalized the planetarium's production
  procedures and reinstated the planetarium's Artist position. He was the first
  PhD to head the Morrison Planetarium and was active in the Academy's Curator's
  Forum, serving as one of its first chairpersons. Simon was widely known as a
  lecturer with the ability to bring an understanding of astronomy to the layman
  and was an invited lecturer on total eclipse expeditions in Mexico, Russia,
  and Indonesia.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1981, Dr. Simon solicited reports from eight individuals,
  staff members and outside consultants, to help him determine the future
  direction for Morrison Planetarium. These reports proved to be invaluable as a
  basis for changes that would be made during the next ten years. Unfortunately,
  in February 1982 Simon suffered a stroke while he was on a family ski trip. He
  returned to work after recuperating for several months but was unable to
  resume his administrative duties. Simon was then appointed Staff Astronomer
  and served in that capacity for more than a year. His counsel during this time
  was very valuable in determining the planetarium's long-range plans. Simon
  retired from the planetarium in 1984.</p>

  <p>For the next sixteen years, Simon involved himself in community service,
  mostly in California's Marin County, where he resided. He was active in Indian
  Guides, Cub Scouts, and Boy Scouts in Marin County. He was also an
  enthusiastic fundraiser for the Marin YMCA. He was a founding member of the
  Stroke Association of Marin and actively participated in classes at the
  Disabled Student Program at the College of Marin. He was a member of the St.
  Vincent de Paul Society at Our Lady of Loretto Church.</p>

  <p>Simon died of leukemia on 18 January 2000. He is survived by Mary Jo, his
  wife of 34 years, and three sons: Daniel of Novato, California; Stephen of Los
  Angeles, California; and John with wife Jennifer and children Kaylee and James
  of Seattle, Washington.</p>
