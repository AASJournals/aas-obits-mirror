  <p>Arthur Edwin Covington, Canada's first radio astronomer and founder of the
  daily 10.7-cm solar flux patrol, died peacefully in his home in Kingston,
  Ontario after a lengthy illness on 17 March 2001. He was eighty-eight years
  old. His wife Charlotte and their four children, Nancy, Eric, Alan, and Janet
  survive him.</p>

  <p>Covington was born in Regina and educated in Vancouver. Deeply absorbed
  with radio science and astronomy from his youth, Covington graduated in
  mathematics and physics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1938.
  He stayed at UBC to complete a Master's thesis on lens design for electron
  microscopes. But in 1940 he moved to the University of California, Berkeley,
  to begin graduate studies in nuclear physics. He met and married fellow
  physics student Charlotte Anne Riche in Berkeley. In 1942, the Covingtons
  moved to Ottawa to join Canada's wartime research effort in radar at the Radio
  Branch of the National Research Council's Laboratories (NRCL).</p>

  <p>Well aware of Jansky's and Reber's discoveries of “cosmic radio noise” at
  metric wavelengths, at the end of the war Covington proposed to use converted
  radar equipment operating at a wavelength of 10.7 cm to probe the galactic
  center using the Sun's decimetric emission as a calibrator for deriving the
  cosmic-noise spectrum. His first attempts to measure the integrated flux over
  the solar disk in July 1946 did not produce consistent flux levels from day to
  day. The sun was quite active with large sunspots, so Covington was uncertain
  whether his instruments, local interference, or the Sun caused the daily
  variations, and he struggled to interpret these inconsistencies. Charlotte
  Covington, his wife, pointed out that a forthcoming partial solar eclipse
  would be visible from Ottawa on 23 November 1946. Covington seized this chance
  to measure the solar flux variations as the Moon occulted a large sunspot. In
  that single observation, he provided the first decisive proof that dark
  sunspots are associated with discrete hot sources of decimetric radiation.
  Over the next year of uninterrupted daily measurements of the integrated flux,
  Covington established that the variability of the 10.7-cm flux closely matched
  that of the sunspot numbers. Both measures were modulated by the comings and
  goings of active regions and the solar rotation.</p>

  <p>Covington's groundbreaking studies of what came to be called the slowly
  varying component of solar radio emission quickly took advantage of other
  wartime developments at NRCL. A unique combination of a 46 m-long slotted
  wave-guide and two parabolic cylinders, erected in 1951 south of Ottawa, was
  the first device built in Canada to detect radio emissions from discrete
  astronomical sources. It was one of the earliest compound microwave
  interferometers; its narrow fan beam enabled Covington and N. W. Broten to
  measure solar limb brightening and the temperatures above isolated sunspots.
  With W. J. Medd, Covington began a series of experiments in the early 1950's
  to improve the relative and absolute accuracies of the daily observations of
  integrated Solar radio flux. In the process, they laid the foundation for
  future confidence in the daily 10.7-cm flux as an objective index of solar
  activity.</p>

  <p>Over the next decade, these early successes paved the way for the NRC to
  establish the Algonquin Radio Observatory for galactic and solar astronomy at
  a remote radio-quiet site beside Lake Traverse, Ontario. Covington chose to
  continue with solar research for the rest of his career. He had, from the
  beginning, grasped the practical importance of solar-terrestrial research
  using the 10.7-cm flux as a proxy for ionizing solar radiation. The
  ever-growing list of applications for the daily 10.7-cm flux is a tribute to
  Covington’s persistence in raising the quality of the measurements to the
  highest standards. The monitoring program was extended long past his
  retirement in 1978. The program, now in its 54th year, continues at the
  Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton.</p>

  <p>Covington's colleagues at NRCL honored him, shortly after he retired, by
  erecting a unique sundial at a site overlooking the building where he pursued
  his solar researches for over 25 years. It is an 0.9-m parabaloidal reflector
  supported on a framework of 10-cm wave-guide, with a 10-cm dipole feed at the
  focus as a gnomon.</p>

  <p>Covington never forgot that his youthful passion for astronomy was nurtured
  among amateur enthusiasts in the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. He
  contributed generously and with evident pleasure in many ways throughout his
  career to the Ottawa Centre.</p>

  <p>Beneath Covington’s reserved, orderly exterior there laid a quirky sense of
  humor and a generous spirit. He was fascinated by arcane topics as well, such
  as religious mysticism, especially if they had a solar connection. He was an
  avid collector of books—new and old—that reflected his wide-ranging interests,
  particularly in the history of radio science and the interrelationship of
  astronomy with other disciplines. He and Charlotte set up the Riche-Covington
  Trust at Queen's University, Kingston, to house his collection on the
  development of radio science in Canada. He leaves these tangible legacies, but
  his many friends will fondly remember him as much for his devotion to his
  family and to solar science.</p>
