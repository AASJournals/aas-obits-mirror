      <h1>Yoshihide Kozai (1928-2018)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>The following text is adapted from a statement issued jointly by the
  Astronomical Society of Japan and the National Astronomical Observatory of
  Japan:</p>

  <p>Dr. Yoshihide Kozai, the last Director General of the Tokyo Astronomical
  Observatory (TAO), and the founding Director General of its successor, the
  National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), and former President of the
  International Astronomical Union (IAU) died at the age of 89 in Tokyo on 5
  February 2018. His specialty was celestial mechanics applied to satellites —
  natural or artificial — and he was a member of the Division on Dynamical
  Astronomy (DDA) of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).</p>

  <p>Dr. Kozai’s early career coincided with the exciting era of space
  exploration when it was literally taking off. One of his prominent works
  conducted during his stay in the United States from 1958 to 1963 is included
  in the AAS’s centennial Issue, a special edition of the Astrophysical Journal
  published in 1999. He enabled the precise forecast of the orbital motion of
  artificial satellites around the Earth. The current generation might be
  familiar with the Kozai mechanism (often called the Kozai-Lidov mechanism),
  which can explain the migration of giant planets into the proximity of their
  host stars. Its original application was for the moons of Saturn, and it is
  applicable to exoplanetary systems.</p>

  <p>After his return to Japan, Dr. Kozai promoted celestial mechanics research
  at TAO while he was affiliated with the University of Tokyo. Later he became
  the Director General in 1981 and led the conversion of TAO to a national
  institution integrating other institutions. He continued as the first Director
  General of NAOJ until 1994. Faced with the daunting task of promoting
  world-class research at NAOJ and in Japan, he established or initiated
  advanced observational facilities (for example, the Subaru Telescope and
  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA) and high-performance
  computing facilities. The current Director General of NAOJ, Dr. Masahiko
  Hayashi, says, “Dr. Kozai wanted his fellow astronomers in Japan to engage and
  solve the fundamental problems of the universe by utilizing these facilities.
  We — the current generation — owe much to him.”</p>

  <p>Dr. Kozai’s work was not confined in Japan. He served as President of the
  IAU from 1988 to 1991 and was the first Japanese to take that position. For
  his long years of research and education, the AAS DDA honored him with its
  Brouwer Award in 1990.</p>

  <p>His fellow astronomers and astronomy educators celebrated his 90th birthday
  only two months ago, according to the traditional Japanese account of a
  person’s age. As he was always, his curious mind went beyond his boldest
  students’ imaginations, asking the participants many questions. One could see
  his influence in many areas, inside and outside of academia.</p>

  <p>It made no difference to him whether one is at a university or not, or
  whether a person is in Japan or abroad. After all, the sky is one and we know
  only one universe to cherish. Dr. Kazunari Shibata, the current president of
  the Astronomical Society of Japan (ASJ), says, “Dr. Kozai was the president of
  ASJ between 1983 and 1985. The community mourns this tremendous loss of a
  shining star from this world. The only encouraging thought is that his legacy
  is well alive amongst the hearts of many.”</p>
