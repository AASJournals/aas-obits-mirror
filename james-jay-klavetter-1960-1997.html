      <h1>James Jay Klavetter (1960-1997)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Our colleague and friend, James Jay Klavetter, Assistant Professor of
  Astronomy at California State University, Sacramento, died of leukemia on 24
  February 1997, at his home in Sacramento. Jim is survived by his parents
  Elaine and Floyd, sister Mary, and brothers Elmer and Floyd. Jim will be
  remembered as an inspired individual whose fascination with Nature shaped his
  life; he studied astronomy professionally and spent his leisure time outdoors
  with his dogs and his friends.</p>

  <p>Jim was born on 12 December 1960. He was introduced to observational
  astronomy as a research assistant in the summer of 1981, unveiling a passion
  which continued throughout his life. In 1983, Jim received his undergraduate
  degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His
  undergraduate thesis, under Dick French and James Elliot, concerned the
  stabilization of the braided rings of Saturn by shepherd satellites. At MIT,
  Jim also worked with Ted Dunham on the effect of turbulence in aircraft
  boundary layers on the formation of images, to address imaging problems
  experienced with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. During graduate school, Jim
  participated in photometric studies of variable stars, asteroids, and
  planetary satellites. Based on precise and well-sampled observations, which
  Jim obtained during marathon observing sessions at Kitt Peak, his ScD thesis
  (1989 MIT), under Jack Wisdom, demonstrated the chaotic nature of the
  rotational state of the Saturnian satellite Hyperion. This work is featured in
  Ivars Peterson's book <em>Newton's Clock: Chaos in the Solar System</em>.</p>

  <p>Jim worked from 1989 to 1992 as a postdoc with Mike A'Hearn at the
  University of Maryland, using CCD images of CN to study the gaseous jets in
  Comet Halley. Their work strongly suggested that the CN was released from an
  extended source in the comet's coma, possibly refractory organic material.
  During this time, Jim also made infrared observation of Comet Levy at the NASA
  Infrared Telescope Facility, from which he and Susan Hoban extracted the
  spatial extent of methanol in the comet's coma. In 1993, Jim joined the
  faculty at California State University (CSUS), Sacramento. At CSUS he was an
  energetic teacher, researcher, and faculty adviser to the local chapter of the
  Society of Physics Students. Jim involved his students at CSUS in his studies
  of near-infrared spectrophotometic observations of Saturnian satellites and
  the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts. He helped out with the Sacramento Valley
  Astronomical Society and visited local grade schools to share his wonder of
  astronomy with the children. Jim loved teaching and was well liked among his
  students. He will also be remembered for his cheerful laughter and humor which
  remained with him until the end.</p>

  <p>In addition to studying and teaching astronomy, Jim had an insatiable
  desire to engage Nature, and he reveled in introducing Nature to others. Jim
  started the continuing tradition of the full moon hike up Old Rag in
  Shenandoah National Park for graduate students and postdocs at the University
  of Maryland. He loved skiing, swimming, biking, mountaineering, and climbing;
  his apple pies and slide shows of his advertures will be remembered fondly by
  many.</p>

  <p>It would be inappropriate to write about Jim Klavetter without placing
  special emphasis on his love for his dogs, Athabasca and Reudi, and later, in
  Sacramento, Pingora. Jim's dogs accompanied him everywhere, at work and at
  play. Jim joyously taught Athabasca to press the handicap button to open the
  door so she could let herself out, and he taught Reudi, part doberman and part
  something-else-big, to jump into his arms like a child. To those who knew him
  and to many who only saw him around campus, he will be remembered fondly by
  his self-appointed moniker: "the guy with the dogs." Athabasca is pictured
  with her friend Jim.</p>
