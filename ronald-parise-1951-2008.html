  <p>Ronald A. Parise, astronomer and astronaut, passed away at his home in
  Burtonsville, Maryland, in the presence of his family on 9 May 2008. He died
  of a brain tumor at age 56 after several years of valiant struggle. He was an
  inspiration to many students, ham operators, astronomers, and friends the
  world over. His enthusiasm for astronomy and space exploration was infectious.
  We, colleagues at Goddard Space Flight Center and Computer Sciences
  Corporation, treasured his contributions to space astronomy and human
  spaceflight.</p>

  <p>Ron, along with Samuel Durrance, flew as Payload Specialist on Astro-1 and
  Astro-2. They were selected by peers from the instrument teams of the Hopkins
  Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT provided by Hopkins University), the Ultraviolet
  Imaging Telescope (UIT, Goddard Space Flight Center) and the Wisconsin
  Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimetry Experiment (WUPPE, University of Wisconsin).
  Astro-1 flew 2-10 December 1990 on the Columbia. Astro-2 flew 2-18 March 1995.
  Ron carried along amateur radio equipment and operated on the air during his
  free time during the missions.</p>

  <p>Ron was born 24 May 1951 in Warren, Ohio, to Henry and Catherine Parise.
  His interests first were in amateur radio, becoming a licensed operator by age
  eleven. He later was attracted to both astronomy and aviation, becoming a
  pilot in his teens. Ron graduated from Western Reserve High School in 1969 and
  attended Youngstown State University where he received a bachelor of science
  degree in physics with minors in mathematics, astronomy. and geology. His
  graduate work was at University of Florida where he obtained a masters degree
  in 1977 and a doctorate in 1979 in astronomy.</p>

  <p>Ron joined Operations Research, Inc. upon graduation, working at Goddard
  Space Flight Center where he supported studies of several NASA missions. In
  1980 he joined Computer Sciences Corporation supporting the International
  Ultraviolet Explorer [IUE], first as a data-management scientist and later as
  the section manager of the IUE hardcopy facility. By 1981 he joined a team of
  engineers and scientists beginning the development of the newly selected the
  Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT), selected by NASA to fly on board the
  space shuttles as an attached Spacelab experiment. The UIT project, headed by
  Ted Stecher as Principal Investigator, was one of three ultraviolet
  experimental telescopes selected to fly together as an Office of Space
  Sciences [OSS] payload. Initial plans were for multiple flights with emphasis
  of observing Halley's Comet in three missions from November 1985 to summer
  1986.</p>

  <p>Ron's responsibilities involved flight hardware and software development,
  electronic system design, and mission planning activities for UIT. His
  proficiency led to his selection by the Principal Investigators of the three
  instruments as a Payload Specialist candidate and acceptance by NASA as one of
  three payload specialists in support of the series of missions. He, Samuel
  Durrance, and Kenneth Nordsieck shouldered the responsibilities of training as
  payload specialists for the instruments integrated on a common pointer, the
  Spacelab Instrument Pointing System, IPS. As a team they represented the
  operational needs of the instrument teams and trained to fly with the shuttle
  team. Preparations moved forward to the March 1986 launch date of Astro-1 to
  observe Comet Halley and well over a hundred astronomical sources.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Challenger accident occurred 28 January 1986,
  thirty-five days before the intended launch date of Astro-1. Ron and Sam, as
  prime Payload Specialists, and Ken as backup/ ground communicator, took the
  delay well, staying focused on training to ensure that Astro-1, delayed until
  December 1990, would be an outstanding success. With at least thirteen launch
  delays, and on-orbit operational problems, they, the professional astronaut
  crew, the science teams, and the multitude of engineers and mission support
  staff managed to accomplish a very successful astronomy mission. Even though
  Comet Halley was not observed by Astro-1, well over a hundred papers on
  multiple astronomical sources resulted from Astro-1 and Astro-2.</p>

  <p>Ron participated in a number of observational astronomy projects using data
  from ground-based observatories, Copernicus, IUE, and the Astro observatory.
  His interests were primarily in circumstellar matter within binary star
  systems and globular- cluster evolution. He bridged the gaps between science,
  engineering, and spaceflight operations. After the completion of the two Astro
  missions, Ron supported NASA studies in advanced communications for
  spaceflight missions and was involved in projects in the Advanced
  Architectures and Automation Branch developing standard Internet Protocols
  [IP] in space-data transmission applications.</p>

  <p>Throughout his career, Ron supported education both by appearances at
  schools and through his amateur radio interests. Indeed, he had a large
  following of ham radio operators as he, along with Frank Bauer, brought about
  the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment [SAREX] payload that enabled many schools
  to talk to Shuttle crew members in space. Ron's love for amateur radio and for
  inspiring students came to focus through the Amateur Radio on the
  International Space STation [ARISS] program. His volunteer help was key in the
  development of those systems now on board the ISS.</p>

  <p>As Frank Bauer, a ham colleague, put it in his tribute to Ron Parise,
  WA4SIR SK: may your exploration spirit live on in us all!</p>

  <p>Ron leaves behind his wife, Cecilia; son, Nicholas; daughter, Katharine;
  his parents Henry and Kathryn Parise; and sister, Rita Parise.</p>
