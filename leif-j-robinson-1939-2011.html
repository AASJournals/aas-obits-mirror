  <p>Leif J. Robinson, Editor in Chief of <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> magazine
  from 1980 to 2000, died at his home in Costa Rica on 27 February 2011.
  Robinson’s editorial stewardship, which emphasized journalistic accuracy and
  integrity, helped boost the magazine’s profile and circulation among both
  amateur and professional astronomers.</p>
  
  <p>Robinson was born on 21 May 1939, in Connecticut. He moved to Southern
  California in 1954, where he joined the Los Angeles Astronomical Society and
  attended UCLA. Following the appearance of his first article in <i>Sky &amp;
  Telescope</i>, in 1960, he became a frequent contributor on a host of topics
  related to amateur astronomy, variable stars, and lunar cartography. A
  <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> press release reports that, while visiting his
  grandparents in Connecticut in 1962, Robinson received a telegram offering
  him an editorial position at the magazine. He initially planned to reject
  the offer in order to complete his studies at UCLA, but changed his mind
  after speaking with <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> office staffer Caroline
  Nason, whom he would later marry. Robinson advanced through several
  editorial positions until 1980, when he was named the magazine’s third
  Editor in Chief (after Charles Federer and Joseph Ashbrook).</p>

  <p>In person, Robinson was gregarious, quick-witted, and a fascinating
  conversation partner. (I completed several <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> book
  projects under his tenure.) But his tell-it-like-it-is ire would
  occasionally reveal itself in the pages of the magazine when confronted with
  some case of institutional illogic or spurious science. In a January 1999
  opinion piece, provocatively titled "Stupidity Squared,” Robinson fumed
  against congressional cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider,
  then pilloried the International Space Station, which he deemed a "grossly
  over-budget, overpriced, $25 to $50 billion flying fiasco." Another op-ed,
  "Astronomers Are Jerks," lambastes colleagues who needlessly alarmed the
  public over a mile-wide asteroid projected to possibly strike Earth in 2028;
  follow-up calculations slashed the impact risk to “zero,” a flip-flop that
  Robinson found detrimental to the public’s perception of science. In October
  1990, he sounded an optimistic (and prophetic) note following reportage of
  the Hubble Space Telescope’s misshapen primary mirror: “Time should soften
  today's public image of HST, for I truly believe the telescope will hit many
  home runs.”</p>

  <p>Robinson was a tireless advocate of professional-amateur collaborations
  in the search for asteroids, comets, and supernovae, especially with the
  rapid advancement of digital imaging and computer technology. “I was one of
  the few people to walk in both communities with equal facility,” he
  said.</p>

  <p>After authoring more than 250 articles and editing many more, Robinson
  retired from <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> in 2000. But he continued to pen the
  magazine's popular “50 &amp; 25 Years Ago” column and deliver talks to
  amateur astronomy organizations. From 2001 to 2005, he served on the Board
  of Directors of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He also authored
  the book <i>Outdoor Optics</i>, a compendium of practical information about
  binoculars. Robinson was an expert birdwatcher, an avocation that garnered
  much of his attention during his retirement years. Asteroid 1983 AR is named
  in his honor. Robinson is survived by his second wife “Ollie,” son Leif,
  Jr., and daughter Cara.</p>

  <p>Celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his beloved magazine in
  November 2001, Robinson summed up his take on the advancement of cosmic
  studies: "Astronomy two generations ago was simple, but only in retrospect.
  … As I finish this piece while listening to Elgar's <i>Enigma
  Variations</i>, I can't help but giggle at how many <i>big</i> unknowns
  surely await discovery!"</p>
