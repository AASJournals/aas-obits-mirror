  <p><strong>Donald Lynden-Bell died on Monday the 5th of February 2018.</strong></p>

  <p>Donald Lynden-Bell, who passed away at the age of 82, possessed one of
  the most lively and energetic mathematical minds of his generation. His
  contributions to astrophysics were profound and far-reaching, earning him in
  2008 a share (with Maarten Schmidt of Caltech) of the inaugural Kavli Prize
  for Astrophysics; he was elected a Fellow of The Royal Society in 1978,
  awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Gold Medal in 1993, appointed to
  the Chair of Astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy Cambridge from
  1972-1997, served several terms as its Director (alternating in that role
  for five-year stretches with Lord Rees of Ludlow, then Cambridge
  University's Plumian Professor at the Institute), served as President of the
  Royal Astronomical Society from 1985-87, and was appointed CBE in 2000) for
  “services to astronomy”.</p>

  <p>Donald flourished under top-quality mathematics teaching at school, at
  University (Clare College, Cambridge), and subsequently in graduate studies
  in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, thriving
  on good advice and revelling especially in solving problems. Post-graduate
  studies (leading to a PhD in 1960) took him deep into realms of stellar
  dynamics, a topic that dominated his research well into the future. As
  others have recounted in the many tributes which have already been paid in
  his honour, his academic achievements had — and continue to have —
  significant impacts. The idea (which he proposed in 1969, and was the first
  astronomer to do so) that most large galaxies harbour a super-massive block
  hole at their cores, has been amply verified by observation and is widely
  accepted as the source of the enormous energy radiated by quasars.</p>

  <p>Donald exercised his abilities very actively, generous in sharing time
  with students through his fascination in every problem that demanded a
  solution. His was a genuine curiosity rather than an inquisitiveness, and
  many a conversation begun casually evolved into hours of vigorous
  discussions at a blackboard (a convenient medium, he claimed, because errors
  could be corrected readily as one went along). His methods, if sometimes
  slightly daunting to the more faint-hearted, sought to teach by encouraging
  the student (or listener) to think proactively, by posing questions whose
  answers he may already have known but if not then the ensuing discussions
  kept both student and teacher hard at it.</p>

  <p>Even so, there was nothing tyrannical in Donald's use of his knowledge.
  Endowed with a strong good humour, he shared jokes easily even when they
  went against himself. Amiable, a generous host, universally liked and
  respected, he did not stand upon dignity, despite his many academic
  achievements, and was uninterested in fine food or in buying expensive
  goods. As he cycled home from the Institute he “enjoyed [his] nightly
  encounter with the holly-bush” that caught many a cyclist off-guard at a
  sharp corner in the back path from the Institute. His laughter — as loud as
  his lectures — was a core component of social gatherings, and on one
  occasion (still remembered by those present), when playing a game of cricket
  with astronomers near the Observatories, he interrupted the proceedings —
  almost a sacrilegious act on British soil — in order to chase after a pet
  rabbit that had temporarily evaded captivity. He never seemed to mind being
  proved wrong; after all, it was eliminating all the blind entries that led
  one to the root of a problem. He was in essence unconventional, and disliked
  sight-seeing and most other forms of potted entertainment, probably because
  of the reduced initiative required of the observer, vastly preferring hiking
  in wild and often intractable terrain, or rock-climbing (when the need to
  confront and solve problems was surely acute).</p>

  <p>Donald may have been born under a lucky star. His great-grandfather was
  acquainted with the astronomer John Herschel, and his father (an army
  Colonel) inherited a telescope with which he was easily able to inspire his
  son by demonstrating the wonders of the night sky. Being in the right place
  at the right time seemed somehow easy; positions in scientific departments
  opened up in Cambridge, then at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Sussex,
  and then again in Cambridge as Professor at the Observatories (when he was
  in fact beginning to feel the need for experience in observational
  astronomy), at timings that seemed to chime fortuitously with his plans (if
  he ever really had any), but certainly with his choices. Inevitably, though,
  the Professorship at the Institute of Astronomy included administration,
  which he himself admitted was perhaps his least favourite aspect of duty as
  a research astronomer. An aspect of Donald's life that is somewhat less
  known was his deep commitment to the church. It is frequently — though not
  always correctly — assumed that science and religion are antithetical, but —
  as in his own field of astronomy — Donald was prepared to stand for what he
  believed in, unpopular though it might seem. He worshiped regularly at the
  Anglican church of St. Edward King &amp; Martyr in Cambridge, and
  volunteered as sacristan, taking care to clean the chalice scrupulously
  after Holy Communion “to make sure all the lipstick was removed”.</p>

  <p>Donald's prowess in dynamical astronomy won him a nomination to deliver
  the annual “Oort Lecture” in March 1992 at Leiden University. Oort himself
  was still active then (and for another 6 months). Donald had strong
  admiration from those whose achievements formed the bases of his own
  research; the photograph of Donald with Professor Oort, taken at Leiden
  during his visit, depicts well that admiration.</p>

  <p>With his zest for communicating, discussing and thinking out loud, Donald
  gravitated to groups of like minds with whom to work, striking up
  partnerships abroad as well as nearer home. The trio known colloquially as
  “ELS” (Olin Eggen, Donald Lynden-Bell and Allan Sandage) achieved much
  during a partnership during the 1960s, arguing that the Milky Way originated
  through the dynamic collapse of a single large gas cloud, while the “Seven
  Samurai” (in which he collaborated with Sandra Faber, David Burstein, Alan
  Dressler, Roger Davies, Roberto Terlevich and Gary Wegner) flourished in the
  1980s, perhaps the climax being the postulated existence of the Great
  Attractor — a huge, diffuse region of material about 250 million light-years
  away that results in the observed motion of our local galaxies. Away from
  the office (but never away from astronomy), Donald had also sought the
  company of four British “ex-pats” (Roger Griffin, John Hazelhurst, Wal
  Sargeant and Nick Wolf) who had all gravitated to Caltech during the early
  1960s — years when Britain had somewhat less to offer than did California to
  someone at the junior end of a career in astrophysics — and participated
  actively and happily in weekend outings involving hiking and visiting
  observatories in the deserts of South-West USA. For other sporting exercises
  he took on anyone willing at table- tennis or squash, and was renowned as
  being a serious champion at both, in part at least because his style was
  “like no other”, perhaps reflecting his non-classical approaches to so many
  questions of the dynamics of moving bodies. But he was a superb sportsman,
  and rarely happier that when someone took up the challenge to play against
  him, and won.</p>

  <p>All of these traits are evident in Alison Rose's recent documentary
  film <em>Star Men</em>, in which four of those five British astronomers
  revisited some of their former hiking haunts in SW USA, and newer
  observatory installations too, and ruminated about technological progress,
  the stars, and life itself as it now appeared to them 50 years on. Donald's
  equable nature, his sense of humour, his evident comfort with even deep
  personal questions, his streak of spiritual commitment, and his valuable
  balance of realism, now all very mature, shine through clearly.</p>

  and to Donald's former colleagues Martin Rees, Paul Murdin, Keith Tritton,
  Wyn Evans and Roger Griffin (all in Cambridge) for graciously offering
  information. I have also drawn extensively from published tributes to
  Donald, including the autobiographical sketches which he himself wove into
  his major article, <em>Searching for Insight</em> (2010, ARA&amp;A, 48, 1).
  I also thank staff at Leiden Observatory for hunting down the copyright
  holder of the photograph reproduced here.</p>
