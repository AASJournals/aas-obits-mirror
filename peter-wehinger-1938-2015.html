  <p>Peter Augustus Wehinger, an observational astronomer known for his work on
  comets and quasars, died in his sleep on 27 April 2015 at the age of 77 in his
  home in Tucson, Arizona. He had battled non-smokers’ lung cancer for most of
  the previous year. His career spanning almost fifty years began with
  construction of a 1.3-m telescope at the University of Michigan and ended
  after retirement from the Steward Observatory where he helped advance major
  telescope projects and raise funds for student scholarships. He was born and
  grew up in Goshen, New York where he developed an early interest in astronomy.
  At age 15 he ground, figured and polished a 6-inch telescope mirror in the
  kitchen of his family home with encouragement from his parents. Backyard
  explorations of the sky with his home-built telescopes plus participation in
  high school science projects and amateur astronomy events inspired and laid
  the foundation for Peter’s career in observational astronomy.</p>

  <p>After graduation from Goshen High School, Peter completed a physics major
  at Union College and a master’s degree in astronomy at Indiana University two
  years later. He earned his doctoral degree from Case Western Reserve
  University after which he joined the Department of Astronomy at the University
  of Michigan. There he oversaw the funding, design and construction of the
  1.3-m telescope, initially located at a dark site near Ann Arbor. Still in use
  and now named the McGraw-Hill Telescope, this facility has since been
  relocated to a mountain top site on Kitt Peak, Arizona.</p>

  <p>Peter married Susan Wyckoff, an astronomer and a longtime collaborator, who
  joined him at the University of Michigan. Shortly afterwards they were both
  recruited by the Department of Physics at Tel-Aviv University which with help
  from the Smithsonian Institution had recently established the Wise
  Observatory. Located in the Negev Desert the observatory was equipped with a
  1-m telescope and state-of-the-art image tube detectors that had exceptional
  sensitivity in the red spectral region. In 1973 Wise Observatory spectra of
  comet Kohoutek revealed an array of strong emission features with no apparent
  laboratory counterparts. Laboratory spectra obtained about the same time by
  Gerhard Herzberg and a higher resolution comet spectrum from George Herbig at
  Lick Observatory led to the definitive identification of ionized water in the
  comet, one of the strongest indicators at that time of the high abundance of
  water in a comet.<sup>1</sup></p>

  <p>In the 1970s and 1980s with home bases at the Royal Greenwich Observatory
  and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Peter exploited the
  clear, dark skies of observatories in Australia, Chile, Hawaii and Spain where
  he conducted observing programs to image quasars. These images were among the
  first to reveal extended nebulosity around some of the quasars.<sup>2</sup>
  Collaborators in this early work included Thomas Gehren, Alec Boksenberg and
  Hy Spinrad.</p>

  <p>In the mid-1980s Peter joined Susan in the Department of Physics at Arizona
  State University where they co-led the spectroscopy arm of the International
  Halley Watch, a NASA-sponsored project to coordinate, collect and archive
  ground-based and spacecraft observations of Halley’s comet. This world-wide
  campaign in the pre-internet era culminated in the assembly of one of the
  first astronomical digital archives. The Halley Watch data archive remains
  accessible online through NASA-sponsored links.<sup>3</sup></p>

  <p>Peter capped his career by collaborating in fund raising for large
  telescope projects and student scholarships at the University of Arizona. From
  1995 until his retirement in 2012 he served as a development officer and staff
  astronomer at the Steward Observatory. In this capacity Peter was involved in
  advancing major projects such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the
  Giant Magellan Telescope and the Tokyo Atacama Observatory. Essential
  components of the large telescopes are mirrors of unprecedented size, six to
  eight meters in diameter. The initial shapes of the mirrors are achieved by
  spinning tons of molten glass, a technique developed by Roger Angel at Steward
  Observatory. Alluding to Angel’s spun-glass mirror-casting technique, Peter
  was once quoted as saying "Making big mirrors is like Julia Child making a
  soufflé –– success is in the details". Peter also played major roles in
  establishing the Arizona Astronomy Board and creating the Mt Lemmon Sky
  Center. The names of two main-belt asteroids mark Peter’s diverse legacy in
  astronomy. The first, 4432 McGraw-Hill (1981 ER22) was initially imaged with
  the 1.3-m telescope. The second asteroid was discovered and named after Peter
  by Arizona Astronomy Board member and amateur astronomer, the late David
  Healy.</p>

  <p>Peter was a highly effective and entertaining communicator who devoted much
  of his life to sharing his passion for astronomy. Whether teaching in a
  classroom or popularizing astronomy in a public forum, Peter’s enthusiasm for
  astronomy was palpable and contagious. He was always a strong advocate for
  science students, particularly women and other underrepresented groups. At
  Steward Observatory Peter worked tirelessly to raise and identify financial
  resources to aid students. To this end a fund in his memory for astronomy
  graduate students has been established at the Steward Observatory.
  Contributions to the “Peter Wehinger Fellowship Fund” will endow the fund and

  <p>Peter is survived by his wife, Susan and his brother, Robert Wehinger of
  Syracuse, New York.</p>
