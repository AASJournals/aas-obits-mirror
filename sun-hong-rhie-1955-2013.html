  <p class="normal">Sun Hong Rhie, a former research professor of physics at the
  University of Notre Dame, died of complications from a peptic ulcer at home in
  Granger, Indiana, on 19 October 2013.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rhie was born to Soonyim Kim and Shinwoo Lee (her mother and
  father) on 1 March 1955 near Chiri Mountain in Gurae, South Korea, where her
  father served as the Principal of Gurae High School. Rhie grew up in Gwangju,
  where she was a popular and successful student. She had the highest score
  among women in South Korea on her college pre-entrance exam; she attended
  Seoul National University, where she received her bachelor's degree in physics
  in 1978. Rhie moved to the US for her graduate work and received a master’s
  degree in physics from UCLA in 1982. She then transferred to Stanford
  University, where she met and married David Bennett, a fellow graduate
  student. In 1988 Rhie received her PhD with a thesis on heavy
  fourth-generation neutrinos, supervised by Fred Gilman, and gave birth to her
  daughter, Clara Bennett, later that year.</p>

  <p class="normal">After a short break, Rhie returned to research in 1990 with
  postdoc positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence
  Livermore National Laboratory. At first she focused on the possibility that
  global topological defects might provide the seeds for galaxy formation. She
  and Bennett were the first to calculate the full-sky microwave background
  anisotropies predicted by topological defects and show that these models were
  not consistent with observations.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rhie’s most influential work was in gravitational lensing.
  When the first gravitational microlensing event, MACHO-LMC-1, was discovered
  in 1993, Rhie noticed that the light curve had a feature that could be
  explained by a planetary companion. That spurred her work on multiple-lens
  systems. In 1995 NASA sponsored the Exploration of Neighboring Planetary
  Systems (ExNPS) studies, which considered the possibility of using a
  gravitational microlensing survey to determine the prevalence of Earth-mass
  planets. But it was not known if microlensing was actually sensitive to
  Earth-mass planets, so ExNPS study leaders put out an urgent request to answer
  that question. Rhie and Bennett were the only ones to solve the problem. In
  doing so, they developed the first planetary microlensing light-curve code,
  including finite source effects, and enabled the modeling of all types of
  planetary microlensing light curves.</p>

  <p class="normal">The pair later realized that a space-based microlensing
  survey was the only way to detect Earth-mass planets over a wide range of
  orbital radii, from the habitable zone to infinity. Their concept for a
  space-based microlensing survey was first proposed to NASA in 2000 and later
  selected as a part of NASA’s <i>Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope
  (WFIRST)</i>, which was the top-ranked large space mission in the 2010 decadal
  survey of astronomy and astrophysics. Without Rhie’s work, it is unlikely that
  this space-based microlensing program would be a part of the WFIRST mission
  concept.</p>

  <p class="normal">Many of Rhie’s most important papers involved the theory of
  lensing by systems of multiple <i></i> point masses. She was the first to
  present the triple lens equations that are used for modeling multiple planet
  and multiple star-plus-planet events. Her most noteworthy work was her 2003
  demonstration, through a beautiful perturbation argument, that a lens system
  of <i>N</i> point masses can have 5(<i>N</i> − 1) images for <i>N</i> ≥ 2.
  That followed her 2001 conjecture that the maximum number of images for an
  <i>N</i> point mass lens is 5(<i>N</i> − 1). This problem is equivalent to a
  pure analytical question in mathematics concerning the number of zeros of a
  certain harmonic rational function of degree <i>N</i>.</p>

  <p class="normal">Mathematicians Dmitry Khavinson and Genevra Neumann, while
  working on this same mathematics problem, proved that the maximum number of
  images cannot exceed 5(<i>N</i> − <i></i> 1). They were unsure if 5(<i>N</i> −
  1) images could be achieved until another mathematician, Jeff Rabin, referred
  them to Rhie's work. Their result was considered so noteworthy in pure
  mathematics, it warranted a 2008 review article in the <i>Notices of the
  American Mathematical Society</i> and an accompanying press release.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rhie was enthusiastic about exploring the natural world,
  particularly with Clara. When her daughter was five, Rhie made a family hike
  in Yosemite National Park so much fun by singing and skipping along the trail
  that Clara managed an eight-mile hike without complaint. And no visit to
  Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was complete without Rhie scooping a dollop of
  lava from an active flow.</p>

  <p class="normal">In her later years, Rhie was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
  The disease limited her ability to continue the research she loved and to
  tolerate the refereeing of her papers; as a result, much of her work is
  published only at arXiv.org. The side effects from her treatments interfered
  with her intellectual work, and she voiced much frustration with the lack of
  scientific and medical understanding of the devastating disorder.</p>

  <p class="normal">A special session of the 18<sup>th</sup> International
  Conference on Gravitational Microlensing, held in Santa Barbara, CA, in
  January 2014 was devoted to Rhie’s work. The presentations are available at <a
  href="http://www.nd.edu/SHR_ML18"
  target="_blank">http://www.nd.edu/SHR_ML18</a>.</p>

  <p class="normal">Rhie is survived by her daughter and husband, as well as her
  mother, a sister, Insook Lee, and three brothers, Sanghwa Lee, Sangyong Lee
  and Sangduk Lee.</p>
