  <p>This is to announce regretfully the death of our AAS colleague, Dr. V. A.
  Hughes, a long-time professor of physics and astronomy at Queen's University
  in Kingston, Ontario and since 1900 a professor emeritus in the University. He
  passed away somewhat unexpectedly in the morning hours of 24 April 2001 after
  a brief illness and shortly after celebrating his seventy-sixth birthday. He
  survives in the memories of his wife, Joan, four children and twelve
  grandchildren. In addition, there are around the globe students, past and
  present colleagues, and many friends who will mourn his passing and remember
  him kindly.</p>

  <p>Vic Hughes, as he was generally known, graduated from the University of
  Manchester in December of 1944. For the remainder of the war he was seconded
  to the Telecommunications Establishment in Malvern (UK) where he became
  enamoured with various forms of radio detection. Consequently at the end of
  the war he returned to Manchester and did graduate work in the early days of
  Jodrell Bank under Bernard (later Sir Bernard) Lovell. By 1961 he had become
  Principal Scientific Officer in the British scientific civil service at
  Malvern where he worked with J. S. Hey. That same year he moved to the Radio
  and Space Research station at Slough (UK) and worked until 1963 with J. A.
  Ratcliffe. In 1958 Hughes had visited Canada and the US in connection with the
  development of the Distant Early Warning radar line, and this clearly started
  him thinking about a new life in Canada. He immigrated to Canada in 1963 and
  soon became professor of physics at Queens University.</p>

  <p>Vic Hughes had a long and distinguished career in Radio Astronomy, which
  was recognized formally by the award of a DSc by the University of Manchester
  as a result of his many career contributions. He was present when radio
  astronomy was a fledgling science just after World War II and he took part in
  the early successes that created the mature discipline that we have today. He
  bounced radar off day-time meteor streams with Lovell, and detected the
  re-entry of Sputnik I. He also got the first short-pulse radar echoes from the
  moon in the effort to determine its distance to about a half a kilometer.
  After moving to Canada and Queen's he turned more towards the deep space
  applications of radio astronomy that were developing so rapidly. He built and
  used a radio dish at Westbrook (a hamlet near Kingston) that was mounted on a
  railway track in the hopes of acquiring a second dish and achieving
  interferometry locally. Unfortunately, the field was moving rapidly away from
  university-based facilities to national facilities and so the station was
  never completed. However, Vic was not one to think small and he did use this
  facility to search for signals from the Galactic center that might have been
  correlated with the emission of gravitational waves.</p>

  <p>Vic moved quickly to use the new national facilities in Canada, Europe and
  the United States, and was welcomed at the Algonquin Radio Observatory, Very
  Large Array in New Mexico, the Westerbork Array and the British Merlin Array,
  among others. He helped to map our own galaxy using these instruments. He also
  suggested free ranging neutron stars as isolated X-ray sources and studied the
  formation of interstellar molecules in this period.</p>

  <p>Gradually Vic became interested in star formation, the early stages of
  which remain a deep mystery. He made important discoveries regarding the radio
  emission associated with the birth of stars generally (for example he was
  codiscoverer of a strange object in the famous Cepheus A region of star
  formation that is known presently as the Hughes-Wouterloot object), and in
  particular he championed their rapid variability at centimeter wavelengths.
  Long and careful study of the Cepheus A region in particular convinced Vic
  that he was seeing gyro-synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated by
  annihilating magnetic fields in giant protostellar flares. Therefore he
  concluded that the process of star formation was a magnetically violent one
  that produced variable sources of high-energy particles. Vic was never content
  to observe and discover without also considering the theoretical implications
  of his results. As such he was ever a stimulating influence in our
  discipline.</p>

  <p>Vic was also active in the various astronomical societies. At his death he
  was a member of the American Astronomical Society and Canadian Astronomical
  Society/Societe Canadienne d' Astronomie (CASCA), the Royal Astronomical
  Society and the International Astronomical Union. He was in addition a
  professional engineer in the province of Ontario. Vic was loyally committed to
  the development of Canadian astronomy, and was a strong supporter of the
  creation of CASCA at a time when many thought that all astronomy should be
  included in the Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP). He was also deeply
  involved in attempts to salvage something from the wreckage of the Queen
  Elizabeth II telescope project. He was chairman of the board of WESTAR for
  long periods, which organization controlled any use of the mirror blank for
  astronomical purposes. He was proud that he had had a hand in preserving that
  asset, which was eventually sold, and the money used to benefit of such
  projects as the Canadian contribution to Gemini.</p>

  <p>Vic Hughes lived a full, sometimes stormy, life as do all those who strive
  after great things. But he was never happier than when working on his data and
  its interpretation for which he had great respect and at which he had great
  skill. Generations of students and faculty at Queen's became accustomed to his
  energetic presence in all seasons and at all hours and recognized the
  unrelenting quest for ideas and discoveries that this represents. He taught
  respect for the serious intellectual life and he was fundamentally a good and
  generous man. We shall miss him.</p>
