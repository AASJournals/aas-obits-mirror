  <p>Professor Benjamin F. Peery, Jr. died at his home in Silver Spring, MD of
  natural causes on 30 November 2010. His full life began in St. Joseph, MO
  (home of the Pony Express) on 4 March 1922.</p>

  <p>His father was a railway mail clerk, so his family moved frequently. Most
  of his childhood was spent in southeastern Minnesota. He enlisted in the army
  in 1942, and served in campaigns in North Africa and Italy. After his
  discharge in 1945, he enrolled in the University of Minnesota, earning a BS in
  Physics in 1949. One of his early hobbies was to build and fly model
  airplanes. His intention to pursue aeronautical engineering changed to
  physics, but after receiving a MS in physics from Fisk University in 1955, he
  decided on a career in astronomy. He told the editors of the PBS series
  <em>The Astronomers</em> (1991, in which his career is highlighted) he thought
  it was shamefully absurd not to know what made the stars shine. So he began
  PhD studies in astronomy at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). His
  dissertation was on the complex eclipsing binary VV Cephei, where a compact
  hot star passes behind a cool giant star, revealing the structure of that
  giant's atmosphere. This task was especially demanding because of the
  complexity of the system's spectrum and the formidable array of observations
  assembled by Ben's advisor, Dean McLaughlin. Fortunately, Ben's strong physics
  background enabled him to design and construct one of the first oscilloscope
  measuring engines, which his fellow students called the PeeryScope. The final
  (1961) dissertation is an impressive combination of observational and
  astrophysical analysis. His degree was obtained in 1962; he had already begun
  a career at the University of Indiana, where he taught and did research
  (1959--1976). The Indiana years were highly productive. In addition to his own
  research, he was advisor on six PhD dissertations, and a master's thesis.
  Several of his students have also had productive careers. An ADS search on his
  students' names brings up several hundred abstracts. He is remembered warmly
  by his departmental colleagues. R. K. Honeycutt writes:</p>

  <p class="rteindent1">Those of us who overlapped with Ben at Indiana have only
  good memories about a good friend. He was a fine stellar astronomer who I
  remember most fondly from our lunchtime conversations. We talked about
  astronomy, politics, university issues, the arts, and human development/human
  nature. With Ben the conversation was always about ideas, not events or
  people. He was a scholar in the best Univ tradition--I learned a lot from Ben
  about being part of a University community.</p>

  <p>His interests remained focused on cool giant stars, like VV Cephei, but
  moved to the study of systems where the radioactive element technetium could
  be identified in the spectrum. This observation, first made by Paul Merrill,
  proved that nuclear transformations involving trans-iron peak elements were
  taking place in stars, and was a keystone of the theory of nucleosynthesis.
  Nucleosynthesis and stellar structure were the main fields of his research
  career.</p>

  <p>In 1977, Ben joined the faculty of Howard University. Shortly before his
  departure from Bloomington, IN, he told me that the new move would mean less
  time for research, and more emphasis on teaching, services, and efforts to
  bring more African Americans into scientific careers. Ben was only the second
  African American PhD in astronomy, and felt a responsibility to increase that
  number and to improve educational opportunities generally for the African
  Americans. He had been involved with the National Science Teacher's
  Association's (ASTA) Elementary School Science Program when he was at
  Indiana.</p>

  <p>At Howard, he was principal investigator on a NASA grant which led to the
  development of research and teaching facilities for astronomy. The grant
  supported both colleagues and students who were able to carry out summer
  research projects at Goddard Space Flight Center. One of the Howard students
  supported by this grant, Professor Araya Asfaw, is now Dean of the Faculty of
  Science at Addis Ababa University. With the help of a National Science
  Foundation (NSF) grant, he worked with a team to provide elementary school
  teachers with the basis for effective teaching in science. He retired from
  Howard in 1992. Ben had served on the Astronomy Advisory Panel of the NSF, was
  a member of the American Astronomical Society's (AAS) Committee on Manpower
  and Employment, was an AAS Visiting Professor, a US representative to the
  International Astronomical Union, and a visiting professor at Harvard
  University and California Institute of Technology. He was a member of the AAS,
  the AAAS, the IAU, ASP, and served as a trustee of the Adler Planetarium in
  Chicago.</p>

  <p>Ben Peery was the oldest of seven brothers (no sisters), so leadership
  undoubtedly came naturally to him. When I came to Michigan in 1957, he was the
  elected graduate student leader. He told the incoming students that it was
  never too early to start studying for prelims--wise advice! His excellent
  physics background enabled him to help fellow graduate as well as his own
  undergraduates; he had a fellowship as an instructor in 1958.</p>

  <p>Ben Peery is survived by his wife, Darnelle and daughter Yvany, and
  brothers Nelson, Alvin, Edward Ross, Norman, Carroll, and Richard.</p>

  <p>We thankfully acknowledge help with this essay from Ben's associates,
  colleagues, and Yvany Peery .</p>
