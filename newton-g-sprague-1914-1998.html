  <p>Newton Gordon Sprague, the first director of the Ball State University
  Planetarium, passed' away on 18 September 1998 at the age of 84. Born and
  educated in Indianapolis, Sprague received a BS in Chemistry from Butler
  University in 1935. Following his graduation Sprague worked as a postal clerk
  because of poor economic conditions that prevailed during the Great
  Depression.</p>

  <p>During World War II, Sprague served as an officer in charge of aerial
  camera repairs for the only night-reconnaissance squadron in the Army Air
  Corps. During this period, he developed and combat-tested a moving-film
  magazine and electric time delay for the K19B camera, and a split vertical
  camera installation for the A-20 aircraft. Sprague worked with Harold E.
  Edgerton in designing and testing the original K29 aerial camera and the D-2
  stroboscopic flash unit.</p>

  <p>After the war, Sprague worked as an industrial chemist, and as an assistant
  in visual productions for the Indianapolis public school system, while taking
  advanced courses in physics, mathematics and science education at Indiana
  University, earning both MA (1950) and EdD (1955) degrees. After he completed
  his graduate education, Sprague was appointed Consultant in Science and
  Mathematics and conducted in-service teacher training for the Indianapolis
  school system. In 1960, Sprague joined the faculty of Ball State University
  (then College) as an assistant professor, handling classes in astronomy and
  teacher education for the physical sciences.</p>

  <p>During the early to mid-1960s, Ball State undertook the development of the
  Cooper Science Center on campus. Sprague took the lead role in designing a
  planetarium and observatory as part of that effort. He traveled around the
  country visiting other planetariums collecting information on their design and
  operation. The planetarium finally selected, a Spitz A3P with a 30-foot dome
  and 77 seats, opened in 1967 along with the remainder of the Cooper Science
  Center, and provided a valuable tool for regional science education as well as
  astronomical orientation. Sprague was an innovative designer and developed a
  unique vibration damping system for the rooftop observatory at the Cooper
  Center. After the opening of the Cooper Center and commissioning of the new
  astronomical facilities therein, Sprague added courses in planetarium
  education to his previous teaching load in astronomy and general science
  education. Sprague attended the 1970 Conference of Planetarium Educators at
  East Lansing, Michigan and was a charter member of the International Society
  of Planetarium Educators (now the International Planetarium Society.)</p>

  <p>After his retirement from Ball State in 1978, Sprague and his wife Rachel
  moved to Florida, where for many years he was an active volunteer in community
  education programs. Jordan Marché provided useful information regarding the
  history on the planetarium used in the preparation of this obituary and his
  assistance is gratefully acknowledged.</p>
