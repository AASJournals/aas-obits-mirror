  <p>John Daniel Kraus, 94, of Delaware, Ohio, director of the Ohio State
  University "Big Ear" Radio Observatory, physicist, inventor, and
  environmentalist died 18 July 2004 at his home in Delaware, Ohio. He was born
  on 28 June 1910 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He received a Bachelor of Science in
  1930, a Master of Science in 1931, and a PhD in physics in 1933 (at 23 years
  of age), all from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. During the 1930s at
  Michigan, he was involved in physics projects, antenna consulting, and in
  atomic-particle-accelerator research using the University of Michigan's
  premier cyclotron.</p>

  <p>Throughout the late 1920s and the 1930s, John was an avid radio amateur
  with call sign W8JK. He was back on the air in the 1970s. In 2001 the amateur
  radio magazine CQ named him to the inaugural class of its Amateur Radio Hall
  of Fame. He developed many widely used innovative antennas. The "8JK closely
  spaced array" and the "corner reflector" were among his early designs. Edwin
  H. Armstrong wrote John in July 1941 indicating in part, "I have read with
  interest your article in the Proceedings of the Institute on the corner
  reflector...Please let me congratulate you on a very fine piece of work."
  Perhaps John's most famous invention, and a product of his intuitive reasoning
  process, is the helical antenna, widely used in space communications, on
  global positioning satellites, and for other applications.</p>

  <p>During World War II, John was in Washington, DC as a civilian scientist
  with the U.S. Navy responsible for "degaussing" the electromagnetic fields of
  steel ships to make them safe from magnetic mines. He also worked on radar
  countermeasures at Harvard University's Radio Research Laboratory. He received
  the U.S. Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his war work. In 1946 he
  took a faculty position at Ohio State University, becoming professor in 1949,
  and retiring in 1980 as McDougal Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering
  and Astronomy. Even so, he never retired. He was always working, researching,
  writing, and seeking new knowledge. He was active and vital to the end.</p>

  <p>Early on, John became fascinated by Karl Jansky's discoveries of radio
  noise from space and the potential to use radio waves rather than visible
  light to "see" the universe. He maintained contact with radio astronomy
  pioneer, Grote Reber. John pursued radio-astronomy research in parallel with
  textbook writing and his OSU teaching responsibilities. By 1953 he was
  observing with a 96 helix antenna and had produced one of the first maps of
  the radio sky. This was followed by his design and construction of the
  innovative, 110-meter, "Big Ear" Radio Telescope - a tiltable, flat reflector
  joined to a fixed, standing, paraboloidal reflector. Observations began in the
  mid-1960s. Interspersed with this work were radio observations of Jupiter,
  Mars, and Venus as well as of the ionized trails of the Sputniks and U.S.
  satellites.</p>

  <p>John and his radio astronomy team discovered some of the most distant known
  objects at the edge of the universe and produced one of the most complete
  surveys of the radio sky. As he stated, "The radio sky is no carbon copy of
  the visible; it is a new and different firmament." He was closely identified
  with efforts and activities related to the Search for Extraterrestrial
  Intelligence or SETI. He edited and published the first magazine on the
  subject called Cosmic Search. The now famous "WOW!" signal, of possible
  extraterrestrial origin, was detected by "Big Ear" in 1977.</p>

  <p>He was the author of hundreds of technical articles and the holder of many
  patents. John was a dedicated educator and inspiring teacher, renown for
  providing plain English solutions to complicated problems. He was thesis
  advisor to 58 PhD and Master's candidates. His textbooks made complex subjects
  accessible to many readers. They have been widely used throughout the world
  and include "Antennas" (McGraw-Hill: 1950, 1988, 2002) and "Electromagnetics"
  (McGraw-Hill: 1953, 1973, 1984, 1992, 1999) and "Radio Astronomy"
  (McGraw-Hill: 1966; Cygnus-Quasar: 1986). They have appeared in Chinese,
  Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, and Portuguese. He also wrote popular
  books, including the autobiographical "Big Ear" and "Big Ear Two"
  (Cygnus-Quasar: 1976, 1995), and the instructional "Our Cosmic Universe"
  (Cygnus-Quasar: 1980).</p>

  <p>His professional memberships included the American Astronomical Society,
  election to the National Academy of Engineering (1972), and Fellow of the
  Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. He received the Centennial
  Medal (1984), the Edison Medal (1985), and the Heinrich Hertz Medal (1990)
  from the IEEE. The Antenna and Propagation Society of IEEE twice awarded him
  its Distinguished Achievement Award, the last in 2003. He was awarded the
  Sullivant Medal (1970) from the Ohio State University and the Outstanding
  Achievement Award (1981) from the University of Michigan.</p>

  <p>John and his wife, Alice Nelson Kraus, whom he married in 1941, were
  committed environmentalists. Alice and he donated the 80-acre Kraus Wilderness
  Preserve to the Ohio Wesleyan University in 1976. They also endowed
  scholarships to enhance environmental learning for students at Ohio Wesleyan
  and OSU. In addition, John was a passionate advocate of metrification in the
  USA. Predeceased in 2002 by his beloved wife, he is survived by two sons, John
  D. Kraus, Jr., and Nelson H. Kraus, and five grandchildren. His professional
  and personal papers are housed at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
  archives in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

  <p>John was viewed by many as a last living link to many of the astonishing
  scientific discoveries of the 20th century. He valued an open mind and direct
  physical insights and was of a by-gone era of hands-on invention, empirical
  testing, and observational research. Yet, he commanded an insightful grasp of
  the theory, which he could translate into thought provoking learning
  experiences for students and working engineers alike.</p>

  <p>In his epilogue to "Big Ear", John said, "I haven't discovered the ultimate
  truths of the universe but I have experienced the thrill and excitement of
  playing a small part in the adventure of exploring the astounding, baffling,
  stranger-than-fiction cosmos in which we dwell."</p>
