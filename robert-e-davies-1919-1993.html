      <h1>Robert E. Davies (1919-1993)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Bob Davies passed from active to Emeritus status at the University of
  Pennsylvania in 1990. A skillful caver, mountain climber, and white-water
  adventurer, he died of a coronary attack while on a climbing trip in rural
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>Bob was born in Lancashire, U.K. of working-class parents and earned his
  D.Sc. from the University of Manchester and Ph.D. from Sheffield. Having been
  on the faculties of Sheffeld and Oxford, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1955.
  Although remaining a British citizen, he spent the rest of his career at
  Pennsylvania.</p>

  <p>His first known involvement with astronomical matters came in service on
  the workshop committee convened by the Space Science Board in June, 1966 to
  evaluate the environment in the Apollo cabin. Publication of the critique of
  the pure O<sub>2</sub> cabin atmosphere by W. O. Fenn and endorsement of that
  critique by Bob did not appear in print until after the on-board and
  laboratory fires.</p>

  <p>A superior teacher-scholar, he held primary or secondary appointments in
  six schools of the University and taught in 17 departments. With his career in
  muscle metabolism completely mature in the 1970's, Bob and William Langer
  created an intensive undergraduate course concerning Origins of Life. This was
  structured to develop the inorganic environment for both biochemical and
  biological evolution and finished with the theory and practice of interstellar
  communication and the practical impediments to space travel. Instantly
  popular, the course was later elaborated by Bob, Paul Wiita, and the writer
  and passed into a challenging General Honors format with the entire term given
  over to student library research and presentations.</p>

  <p>As he gained a deeper awareness of modern astrophysical science, Bob saw
  opportunities where his biochemical expertise could be melded with
  astronomical matters. These also centered around the concept of Life's origins
  and, with an invited paper at the 36th International Astronomical Congress in
  Stockjholm, he contributed the only modern critique of the theme of
  Panspermia. He felt very deeply about developing any claim to the limit of
  evidence and no further, and this attitude was the foundation for his papers
  contending against the existence of interstellar organisms. His widest vision
  of the beginnings and continuation of terrestrial Life was expressed in the
  last paper by himslef and the writer which ended with an estimate of the
  number of galactic supernovae necessary to have created the known abundances
  and concentrations of selected elements essential for Life.</p>

  <p>In the 16 years of Bob's association with the Astronomy Department, he
  remained a congenial, gentlemanly colleague with a common-sensical view of
  science and a passion for human justice tempered by a sardonic view of our
  foibles.</p>
