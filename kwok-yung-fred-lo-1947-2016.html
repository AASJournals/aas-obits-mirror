  <p>Kwok-Yung (Fred) Lo, renowned radio astronomer and former director of the
  National Radio Astronomy Observatory, died on 16 December 2016, at age 69,
  from complications associated with cancer. Born on 19 October 1947 in Nanjing,
  China, Fred Lo arrived in the United States in 1965 to attend the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He graduated with a B.S. in
  Physics in 1969 and a Ph.D., also in Physics, in 1974. His thesis,
  Interstellar Microwave Radiation and Early Stellar Evolution, was supervised
  by Bernard F. Burke, co-discoverer (with Kenneth Franklin) of radio emission
  from Jupiter.</p>

  <p>In a 2008 interview, Lo admitted that upon entering his graduate studies at
  MIT, he “really had very little knowledge of astronomy at all, let alone radio
  astronomy, [and was] thinking of doing something practical, like solid-state
  physics.” But the work appealed to him and he settled on radio astronomy as
  his professional focus. Lo joined the California Institute of Technology
  (Caltech) in 1974 as a Research Fellow in Radio Astronomy, but left in 1976 to
  take up a Miller Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley. Two
  years later, he returned to Caltech as a Senior Research Fellow and was
  appointed Assistant Professor of Astronomy in 1980.</p>

  <p>Lo was an accomplished radio astronomer and physicist whose research
  impacted international scientific progress across multiple fields. His
  interests ranged from mega-masers to star formation, starbursts, the Galactic
  Center, and cosmology. At Caltech, Lo made pioneering very long baseline
  interferometry (VLBI) studies of H<sub>2</sub> O and OH maser emission regions
  with Burke and others. He made the first attempt to detect compact structure
  in SgrA* by VLBI. Numerous VLBI studies of SgrA* followed, involving many
  collaborators. He played a leading role in all three areas but is particularly
  remembered for the classic VLBI studies of SgrA*, the radio source associated
  with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. These showed that at
  centimeter wavelengths the observed size of the radio source is dominated by
  interstellar scattering, thus demonstrating that millimeter VLBI would be
  needed to study this object at radio wavelengths, a basic characteristic of
  today’s Event Horizon Telescope.</p>

  <p>Lo also played a key role in the early construction of Caltech’s Owens
  Valley Millimeter Wave Array, leading the observations that produced the first
  millimeter-wave interferometric map of carbon dioxide emission from an
  external galaxy. In 1986, he and Mark Claussen were the first to suggest that
  luminous water maser emission in external galaxies is circum-nuclear,
  associated with active galactic nuclei, and could serve as very high
  resolution probes of the centers of galaxies. These keen insights led
  eventually to the Megamaser Cosmology Project that is now accurately measuring
  the expansion rate of the Universe and that will yield a direct test of the
  standard cosmological model and meaningfully constrain the nature of dark
  energy; Lo was a driving intellect in the project.</p>

  <p>In 1986, Lo joined the University of Illinois Astronomy Department as a
  full professor. There he established a mm/submm receiver laboratory in
  collaboration with the Illinois solid state physics program, enabling
  construction of the first superconductor–insulator–superconductor (SIS)
  junctions for the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array. The lab also worked with
  the University of Chicago on receiver development for the South Pole
  Telescope. When Lo later became chair of the Astronomy Department, one of his
  major goals was to increase interest in astronomy among freshman students. In
  this context, he developed and oversaw a course in which 12-15 students came
  to professors' homes to discuss hot topics in astronomy and astrophysics in an
  informal atmosphere. At the same time, he was very conscious of increasing
  diversity and made significant efforts to increase the representation of women
  on the faculty.</p>

  <p>Starting in 1990, Lo formed a core group that included Paul Ho, Typhoon
  Lee, Frank Shu, and Chi Yuan to found what became Academia Sinica's Institute
  of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA). in Taiwan. Lo’s commitment to this
  effort is reflected in his service as Distinguished Research Fellow and
  Director of ASIAA from 1997 to 2002. In 1998 he was elected as an Academician
  of Academia Sinica and appointed Professor of Physics at the National Taiwan
  University. His directorship at ASIAA saw a remarkable expansion of Taiwanese
  participation in the some of the most important radio astronomy projects in
  the world: the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland mm-wave array in Hat Creek
  California; the Harvard-Smithsonian Submillimeter-wave Array in Hawaii, and
  the international Atacama Large Millimeter-wave Array in Chile.</p>

  <p>Lo’s eminence as a scientist and scientific leader led to his appointment
  as National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Director and Distinguished
  Astronomer from September 2002 to May 2012, an important decade during which
  the NRAO and its international partners realized the construction and
  initiation of science operations with the Atacama Large
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). His directorship also encompassed the
  Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) project. This was completed on time, to
  specification, and under budget, enabling the reincarnation of the 1970s-era
  VLA as the much more capable Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. In addition, the
  Green Bank Telescope and the Very Long Baseline Array made extraordinary
  progress in their scientific capabilities and productivity. Lo’s vision and
  leadership were vital to each of these major NRAO technical and scientific
  successes. His force of character and remarkable intellect made him a notable
  leader in our profession, across many arenas and over several decades.</p>

  <p>Beginning in 2014, Lo became an advisor to Astron Solutions Corporation, a
  company founded by Frank Shu to use molten salt technology to help mitigate
  climate change. Lo's role was especially important in addressing environmental
  problems in Hong Kong, where he had grown up and still had many friends and
  influential contacts in the academic and private sectors. He took this new
  venture very seriously and even when he was gravely ill, still had energy to
  think of others.</p>

  <p>Many people have commented that, like it or not, you knew where you stood
  with Fred Lo, and you knew what he thought, and why. He was a wellspring of
  ideas and impatient to see them realized. But no matter how hard he drove his
  colleagues, none ever questioned his motivation: excellence in science. His
  piercing questions in colloquia were always matched by patient explanation in
  private, especially for younger researchers. He is truly missed.</p>

  <p>Lo is survived by his wife Helen, their sons Jan and Derek, his mother, Ju
  Hwa Lu, and his brothers K.J., Steve, Kevin, and Alvin Lo and their wives and
  children.</p>
