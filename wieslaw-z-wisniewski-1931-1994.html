      <h1>Wieslaw Z. Wisniewski (1931-1994)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Dr. Wieslaw Z. Wisniewski of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the
  University of Arizona died suddenly and unexpectedly on February 28, 1994 at
  62 years of age. He is survived by his wife and adult son who both live in
  Tucson. Born on May 2, 1931 in Poland, Wisniewski endured many hardships while
  surviving the Nazi occupation of Poland as a young boy, and later during the
  communist regime there.</p>

  <p>In 1951 he began working as a High School Mathematics teacher. In 1952 he
  received an M.A. in Astronomy from Poznan University in Poland. Wisniewski
  then joined the staff at the Cracow Observatory at the Jagiellonian University
  as a Research Assistant in 1953, advancing through the ranks to Lecturer in
  1954. From 1957 to 1959, he participated as a Scientist of the International
  Geophysical Year Expedition to Spitsbergen. He returned to the Cracow
  Observatory staff as a Senior Lecturer in 1959. During a leave of absence from
  the Cracow Observatory, starting in 1963, Wisniewski joined the staff at the
  recently established Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona as a
  Research Associate, becoming an Assistant Professor in 1965. In 1967, he
  returned to the Cracow Observatory as an Assistant Professor before returning
  to the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in 1971 where he remained for the rest
  of his career. He was a member of the American Astronomical Society, the
  Polish Astronomical Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the
  International Astronomical Union.</p>

  <p>Wisniewski's scientific research interests during his lifetime were varied.
  His earliest works, between 1954 and 1956 were computing predictions for the
  occultations of stars by the Moon, published in the Cracow International
  Almanac. In 1957, he published work on the orbit of comet Harrington (1951k)
  in the I.A.U. Circulars. His work in the IGY Expedition to Spitsbergen
  resulted in a paper on the radioactive fallout there. Also resulting from this
  expedition was a paper on aurora observations from Spitsbergen. In 1964,
  Wisniewski confirmed that comets Harrington (1952 II) and Wolf (1925 I) were
  identical by computing the perturbations of the 1952 II elements back to 1925.
  The comet was subsequently renamed P/Wolf-Harrington.</p>

  <p>Upon his arrival at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, he began work with
  Harold Johnson, observing often with a 28 inch telescope near Mount Bigelow in
  the Santa Catalina mountains north of Tucson. The landmark study of over 5000
  bright stars in UBV and some stars in as many as 8 wavelengths was published
  in 1966. During the course of this work, observations were obtained for many
  other interesting objects, including observations of Seyfert Galaxies, RR
  Lyrae stars, and supernovae. His expertise and reputation as an observer
  became well known to his colleagues during this time.</p>

  <p>Wisniewski's interests in the Solar System began to re-emerge when he
  participated in some observations of comet Kohoutek and later of minor
  planets. He collaborated with T. Faÿ in the first study of the nucleus of a
  comet, examining the light curve of P/d'Arrest in 1978. Most recently, he
  worked on the light curve and taxonomic observation of small solar system
  bodies, especially the near-Earth asteroids and comets, providing light curve
  observations of hundreds of asteroids and multi-color photometry of many
  others. He often participated in global campaigns to observe a particular
  object, the best examples being the campaigns to observe (951) Gaspra and
  (243) Ida which were both visited by the Galileo spacecraft as it made its way
  to Jupiter. He was able to obtain one of the early images of comet
  P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 a few nights after its discovery and was very much
  involved in the excitement of observing and learning about this unique comet.
  He would have been part of a global network of observers from the Lunar and
  Planetary Laboratory making optical coronographic observations and he would
  have been very pleased and thrilled by all the surprises that comet provided
  as it plunged into Jupiter this past July.</p>

  <p>In his later years, Wisniewski spent a great deal of time at the telescope
  making single channel photometric observations of various objects and more
  recently began using CCD detectors in his work. Most of his recent
  observations were made using the 60 inch telescope at Mt. Lemmon near Tucson,
  the 61 inch telescope at Mt. Bigelow, and the 90 inch telescope at Kitt Peak,
  all of the Steward Observatory. He also traveled to the southern hemisphere,
  especially to Cerro Tololo. Always one on the lookout for humor in the world
  around him, shortly after learning of the impending impact of P/Shoemaker-Levy
  9 on Jupiter, he found the following quote in a book review: " … the
  astronomer Jérôme Lalande was arrested in 1773 for a breach of the peace, when
  he alarmed the French public with a prediction of a cometary collision." That
  was Wieslaw's way of warning colleagues to take care in their dealings with
  the public as the impact time approached.</p>

  <p>Wieslaw was a dear friend to all those around him. His wit, wisdom, and
  willingness to help and encourage those around him will be greatly missed by
  all who knew him.</p>
