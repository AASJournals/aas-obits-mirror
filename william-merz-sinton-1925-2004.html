  <p>Bill Sinton, one of the pioneers of infrared planetary astronomy, died at
  his home in Flagstaff, Arizona, on March 16th 2004, at the age of 78.</p>

  <p>Bill was born in Baltimore on April 11, 1925. He developed lifelong
  interests in railroads and radios while still a child, and by age 15 he had
  already built a shortwave radio receiver and won his ham radio license. His
  abiding interest in electronic and mechanical devices would serve him well in
  his professional career. He fought with the 26th Infantry Division in the
  Second World War and was wounded in France in October 1944. After the war he
  obtained his bachelor's degree in physics at Johns Hopkins (1949). His
  doctoral work at the same institution, with John Strong, gave him his first
  taste of infrared astronomy, including the first measurements of the moon at
  1-millimeter wavelength. He obtained his PhD, on the infrared spectrum and
  temperature of Venus, in 1953.</p>

  <p>During a 1-year postdoc at Johns Hopkins he probed the lunar subsurface by
  observing the cooling of the moon during eclipse at millimeter wavelengths,
  and observed the diurnal variation in Martian surface temperatures in the
  10-micron window. He joined Harvard College Observatory as a research
  associate and lecturer in 1954, and became interested in the question of life
  on Mars and the then-plausible possibility that Mars's dark markings were due
  to vegetation. In 1956, using a monochromator that he built himself, he
  detected absorptions near 3.4 microns in the Martian spectrum which he
  attributed to a C-H stretch transition in Martian vegetation. These "Sinton
  bands," as they came to be known, sparked great interest at the time, and
  though at least some of the spectral structure was later found to be due to
  terrestrial HDO, and the presence of abundant organic molecules on the Martian
  surface was finally ruled out by the Viking landers, some of the spectral
  features that he detected appear to be intrinsic to Mars and are still not
  well understood.</p>

  <p>In 1957, Bill moved to Lowell Observatory, and spent the next nine years
  there. He considered these to be the most productive years of his career. In
  his time at Lowell, he continued his studies of the Moon's thermal emission,
  and built an infrared Michelson interferometer spectrometer that he put to use
  in identifying the 3.1-micron water of hydration band on Mars. He also met and
  married his wife Marge in 1960, and their three sons, Bob, David, and Alan
  were born during the Flagstaff years.</p>

  <p>In 1965, Bill was invited by John Jefferies to join the faculty of the
  University of Hawaii, and to help in the development of the fledgling Mauna
  Kea Observatory. His work on the design the 88-inch telescope on Mauna Kea,
  the cornerstone of the observatory, included designing its telescope control
  system, making it one of the first computer-controlled optical telescopes. His
  scientific work at the Institute for Astronomy included continued studies of
  Mars, with his PhD student Terry Martin, as well as the infrared spectrum of
  Uranus and Neptune. He sometimes translated his pseudocolored maps of the
  thermal emission from the planets, pixel by pixel, into the unique medium of
  stained glass. In 1979, following the discovery of Io's volcanoes by Voyager,
  he obtained some of the first ground-based observations of the infrared
  thermal emission from the volcanoes. He devoted the last decade of his career
  to the ground-based study of Io's volcanoes, working to characterize their
  time variability and developing techniques to identify their locations on Io.
  He was one of the founding members of the International Jupiter Watch in 1987,
  and was the first leader of its Satellite Discipline.</p>

  <p>When he retired from the University of Hawaii in 1990, he and Marge
  returned to Flagstaff, and he renewed his association with Lowell Observatory
  as an adjunct astronomer. He built a miniature steam-powered railroad around
  his house, to the delight of the neighborhood children who would get to ride
  on it on special occasions. In 1993 he was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's
  disease), and was confined to a wheelchair shortly afterwards, but he
  continued to attend scientific meetings, and to contribute to Lowell
  Observatory as a member of its Advisory Board, till shortly before his death.
  In 2002 he published an autobiography, I Choose to Live, which described his
  life and his battle with ALS. Because he could no longer use a keyboard he
  wrote the entire book using voice-recognition software- a testament to his
  determination to keep as active and productive as possible despite the
  encroachments of the disease.We remember Bill as a warm, gentle, and
  enthusiastic man with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things infrared. He had
  a love of mechanical gadgets of all types, whether he was designing plumbing
  for a He3 cooled germanium bolometer or for a model steam engine. He is
  greatly missed by his family, friends, and former colleagues.</p>

  <p>Within two weeks of Bill's death came the announcement that CH4 gas had
  been discovered on Mars by the Mars Express spacecraft, confirming similar
  results from ground-based telescopes. The methane, touted as possible evidence
  for extant Martian life, was discovered via its 3.3-micron C-H stretch band.
  This is essentially the same vibrational transition, potentially carrying the
  same hints of living Martian organisms, which Bill thought he had seen on Mars
  45 years earlier. So while Bill's initial conclusion that Mars is covered with
  extensive vegetation turned out to be wrong, his insight that the 3-micron
  region, with its telltale signature of carbon-hydrogen bonds, was the best
  place to search for evidence of life on our sister world, may have been right
  all along.</p>
