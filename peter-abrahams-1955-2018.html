  <p><strong>Peter Abrahams passed away on Sunday the 4<sup>th</sup> of March
  2018.</strong></p>

  <p>Peter was born on March 19, 1955, in Los Angeles, California, graduated
  from Reed College in 1977 with a major in English, and lived afterwards in
  Portland, Oregon.</p>

  <p>Peter was an internationally recognized expert on the history of
  telescopes and binoculars, and served on the Executive Committee of the
  Historical Astronomy Division from 2005–2007. He was a frequent attendee and
  presenter at HAD sessions at AAS meetings.</p>

  <p>He was one of the earliest members of the Antique Telescope Society
  (ATS), having joined in 1992. President, Vice-President, and board member
  were positions he held with that organization. The ATS awards the Sir Isaac
  Newton medal to a member for meritorious service and contributions to the
  society: Peter received this award in 2009. Additionally, he was a member of
  the Scientific Instrument Society and the National Coalition of Independent
  Scholars.</p>

  <p>The Rose City Astronomers (an astronomy club in Portland, Oregon) counted
  him as one of their earliest members, and he served as their President for
  five years.</p>

  <p>Peter set the standard for sharing information. His generosity on
  providing information to others was unequalled. His web site contained
  extensive information on historic telescopes and binoculars and was an
  absolute joy to pursue. He was always willing to help anyone with any
  inquiry on telescopes, binoculars, and the history of astronomy.</p>

  <p>Survivors include his daughter Katherine of Portland, Oregon; his
  companion Antonette DeVito of Los Angeles; his mother and stepfather Rosalie
  and Stanley Minsk also of Los Angeles; his sister Barbara of Boulder,
  Colorado; his brother Mike of Tiburon, California; and many nieces and
  nephews.</p>

  <p>Peter died of a sudden heart attack fifteen days short of his 63<sup>rd</sup> birthday.</p>
