  <p>John Michael Anthony (Tony) Danby, 80, died on 8 Dec 2009
  in Chester, Pennsylvania. Born in London, England, on 5 August 1929, Danby
  obtained his B.A. and M.A. in mathematics at Oxford University, where his
  father served as Regius Professor of Hebrew, followed by a Ph.D. in astronomy
  at Manchester University entitled “Some Problems in Cosmology and Stellar
  Dynamics.” After serving as a musician in the England’s Royal Artillery, he
  joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra as first chair oboist. In addition to
  musical performance, he recorded, for the BBC, an oboe sonata dedicated to him
  by the composer Stephen Dodgson.</p>

  <p>In 1957, Danby immigrated to the U. S. to take up a teaching position at
  the University of Minnesota. He also taught part-time at Macalester College
  in St. Paul, where he met his future wife, Phyllis; they were married in
  1958. While at Minneapolis, he wrote his classic textbook, <i>Fundamentals
  of Celestial Mechanics</i>, which was published in 1962 by Macmillan and is
  still in print. A review by William Liller in <i>Science</i> states that
  “this clearly written book covers … all the celestial mechanics with which
  every professional astronomer and senior space scientist should be
  acquainted.”</p>

  <p>Danby subsequently joined the astronomy department at Yale University,
  which at the time included such notables in celestial mechanics as Dirk
  Brower, Morris Davis, Boris Garfinkel, Victor Szebehely, and during Summer
  1962, visiting scholar George Contopoulos. While at Yale, Danby became a
  naturalized U. S. citizen on 11 February 1965. Two years later, he accepted
  a professorship in the Mathematics Department at North Carolina State
  University, where he remained until his retirement in 1998.</p>

  <p>Danby co-authored some 40 research articles plus a second book,
  <i>Astrophysics Simulations</i>, published by Wiley in 1965 and designed to
  foster the application of computers to problems in astronomy. The software
  in the book won an excellence award from the journal <i>Computers in
  Physics</i>. Danby also developed and taught a course at NC State in
  computer modeling, which grew, by the time of his retirement, to an
  enrollment of three hundred students per semester. He received the
  university’s Outstanding Teacher Award in 1979 and an Alumni Distinguished
  Professorship in 1987.</p>

  <p>In 1968, Danby served on the organizing committee involved in the
  creation of the AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy. A minor planet was
  named after him in recognition of his contributions to the study of
  celestial mechanics. Maintaining his passion for music, Danby directed the
  Wake County Chapter of the North Carolina Symphony and founded the Raleigh
  Chamber Players. He was also actively involved in politics, serving as a
  Democratic party precinct chairman for four years. Danby and his wife
  Phyllis enjoyed cooking and hosting parties and fund-raisers, one of which
  had guest list approaching a hundred.</p>
