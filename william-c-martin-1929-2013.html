  <p>William Clyde Martin, one of the leading atomic spectroscopists in the
  world, passed away from complications of pneumonia on September 15, 2013, at
  the age of 83. Martin led the Atomic Spectroscopy Group at the National
  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for 36 years.</p>

  <p>Bill
  Martin was born in Cullman, Alabama, in 1929. He graduated from the University
  of Richmond in 1951 and went on to graduate studies at Princeton University.
  He received a Master’s Degree in physics in 1953 and a Ph. D. in physics in
  1956, both from Princeton. His thesis advisor was the well-known Professor
  Allen Shenstone. Bill’s thesis concerned the spectrum and energy levels of
  neutral and singly ionized phosphorus. This was a challenging project because
  of the difficulty of producing a light source to excite the spectrum of
  phosphorus. But this was successful and served to introduce Bill to the vacuum
  ultraviolet.</p>

  <p>After graduating from Princeton, Bill joined the
  National Bureau of Standards, now NIST. He was hired by William F. Meggers,
  famous for his many investigations of atomic spectra. In 1962 Bill was
  appointed Chief of the Atomic Spectroscopy Section, and he served in this
  position until his retirement in 1998. After retiring, Bill continued his
  research, first as a contractor and then as NIST Scientist Emeritus.</p>

  <p>Bill oversaw the 1965 move of the group from downtown Washington, DC to
  Gaithersburg, Maryland. He was intimately involved in planning the new
  spectroscopy laboratory. To equip the new lab, a number of new instruments had
  to be designed and built. Foremost among them were normal- and
  grazing-incidence spectrographs for observation of the VUV. The spectrographs
  that were built became the basis for numerous ground-breaking publications in
  atomic spectra. In the 1970’s Bill was instrumental in turning the use of
  these instruments to the generation of data for controlled nuclear fusion
  research. Bill had become familiar with this program while at Princeton, where
  some of the first stellerators and tokamaks were being developed.</p>

  <p>Another abiding interest of Bill’s was the compilation and dissemination
  of atomic data. The work had begun at NBS in 1945 when Meggers hired Charlotte
  Moore Sitterly to set up a Data Center to compile spectroscopic data from the
  literature. This resulted in the classic volumes of Atomic Energy Levels
  published in 1949-1958. When Bill became head of the group, he involved
  various members in expanding and updating Moore’s compilations. This gave rise
  to many highly-regarded publications, most of which appeared in the
  newly-formed Journal of Physical and Reference Data (JPCRD), edited by David
  Lide.</p>

  <p>Missing from Moore’s compilations were data for the rare
  earth elements. As a result of advances in this area that had come about from
  new technologies – both experimental and theoretical – there had developed a
  large body of data that needed to be organized and systemized. Bill himself
  had contributed greatly to this area through his analysis of the energy level
  structure of neutral cerium. Bill’s 1963 paper established the electronic
  ground configuration of neutral cerium as 4f5d6s<sup>2</sup>. Prior to that,
  it was widely taken to be 4f<sup>2</sup> 6s<sup>2</sup>. Bill personally led
  the new compilation effort, resulting in publication of “Atomic Energy Levels
  – The Rare-Earth Elements,” by W. C. Martin, R. Zalubas, and L. Hagan. This
  volume has served as the bible for rare earth energy levels since its
  publication in 1978. In recognition of this work Bill was awarded the U. S.
  Department of Commerce Silver Medal (1968) and the Gold Medal (1981). In 1983
  he was awarded the William F. Meggers Award of the Optical Society of America.
  In 1992 he was awarded the NIST Allen V. Astin Measurement Science Award and
  in 1997 the Office of Measurement Services Award.</p>

  <p>With the
  retirement of Charlotte Moore Sitterly in 1968, Bill took over as Director of
  the Atomic Spectroscopy Data Center and became even more deeply committed to
  critical evaluation and compilation of atomic data. Bill directed much of the
  program to provide data for astronomy, probably his area of greatest personal
  interest. He regularly attended meetings of the American Astronomical Society
  and the International Astronomical Union. He served as Chairman of the
  International Astronomical Union Working Group on Atomic Spectra and
  Wavelength Standards, 1973-1997. At one of the AAS meetings, Bill learned of
  potential problems with wavelength calibration of spectrographs on the Hubble
  Space Telescope, under construction at the time. This led to a NIST program to
  provide a suitable wavelength calibration standard for HST. The light source
  that was developed, a platinum/neon hollow cathode with wavelengths provided
  by NIST has been used on Hubble from the time of its launch in 1990 until
  today.</p>

  <p>With the coming of the internet, Bill had the vision to
  realize that the future of data dissemination would be via online databases.
  Together with W. Wiese, he undertook organization of the NIST Atomic Spectra
  Database. This database went online in 1995 and has continued to expand since
  then. It is now in version 5.1, experiencing about 1000 downloads per day.
 </p>

  <p>Bill published over 65 papers in atomic spectroscopy. Together with
  W. Wiese, he wrote the chapter on Atomic Spectroscopy for what is now the
  Springer Handbook of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. His last
  publication was a scholarly work with E. Arimondo of Italy and C. W. Clark of
  NIST on “Ettore Majorana and the Birth of Autoionization.”</p>

  <p>After
  coming to Washington, Bill met and married Dolores Moyano. They bought a house
  in Bethesda and had two sons, Eric and Christian, who survive him. Their home
  was the site of many warm gatherings. Their dinner parties always included
  interesting guests ranging from politicians to poets to journalists to
  scientists. Dolores Martin passed away in 2003.</p>

  <p>Bill loved opera,
  especially the music of Richard Wagner. He traveled the world to see
  performances of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen.</p>

  <p>Bill was a Fellow
  of the American Physical Society, the Optical Society of America, and the
  American Association for the Advancement of Science. He served as Associate
  Editor and Technical Editor of the Journal of the Optical Society of America.</p>

  <p>Bill’s intellectual presence and sense of humor will be greatly
  missed. He was a genuine force for excellence at NIST.</p>
