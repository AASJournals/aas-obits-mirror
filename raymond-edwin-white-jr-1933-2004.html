  <p>Raymond E. White, Jr., died unexpectedly at his home, in the early morning
  hours of October 12, 2004. Death appears to have been caused by severe
  diabetic shock. He retired from the Department of Astronomy/Steward
  Observatory in July 1999 with the title of University Distinguished Professor,
  after serving on the faculty of this institution for over 35 years.</p>

  <p>He was born in Freeport, Illinois, on 6 May 1933, to Beatrice and Raymond
  E, Sr. -the latter being a career soldier in the US Army. Ray's early
  schooling took place in Illinois, New Jersey, Germany and Switzerland,
  following his father's assignments. He obtained a bachelors degree from the
  University of Illinois in 1955. Next Ray enlisted in the US Army, but quickly
  was enrolled in Officer Candidate School. He then served as lst Lt. in the US
  Army Corps of Engineers. Although military affairs remained a lifelong
  interest, and he was a member of the Company of Military Historians, Ray
  decided after three years to return to academia. He entered the astronomy PhD
  program at the University of Illinois in 1958. His PhD dissertation was
  supervised by Ivan R. King. Ray accepted a faculty position at the University
  of Arizona in 1964.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, Ray White was known at Arizona as an excellent teacher,
  revered by a large number of former students. When the astronomy major program
  was begun in 1967, Ray was one of three, original, major advisors. Over the
  next three decades, he was a leader at the University level in reforming the
  undergraduate program and courses. He was selected Outstanding University
  Faculty Member in April 1989 and he served as one of a handful of professors
  who are Faculty Fellows. These Fellows devote untold hundreds of hours as
  part-time residents at student dormitories, to give students a friendly face
  to address their problems. In 1995, Ray was among the first group of faculty
  to be recognized as University Distinguished Professors. In the year of his
  retirement, 1999, University President Manuel Pachecho recognized Ray's
  extensive contributions by asking him to serve as Master of Ceremonies at the
  University commencement.</p>

  <p>Ray White's research career was not as extensive as his teaching
  activities, but it was creative. His original specialty was globular star
  clusters and classes of variable stars within them. He made several catalogs
  of star clusters and associations, measured the exact centers, the axial
  ratios and the orientations of around 100 Galactic globular clusters.
  Certainly, Ray's greatest love in research, especially in later years, was
  archaeoastronomy. He studied the evidence for astronomical observations of the
  Sun, Moon and stars from the mound sites of the prehistoric Hohokam
  inhabitants of the Salt River Valley of Arizona. He was best known for his
  studies of the Inkaic people of the pre-Columbian, Peruvian Andes. Most of
  this research involved the grand Machu Picchu site, where he showed (with
  David Dearborn) that the central tower (the "Torreon") certainly had been used
  as an Observatory. They also discovered a separate, solstice observatory and
  named it Intimachay.</p>

  <p>Characteristically, Ray combined much of his archaeoastronomy research
  interests with the involvement of undergraduate students and adults through
  the Earthwatch program in field trips to Machu Picchu. With a Professor in the
  humanities who was also well known at the University of Arizona, Donna Swaim,
  Ray introduced a group of undergraduates in summer classes to several
  archaeoastronomy sites in such countries as Ireland and the British isles. Of
  course they also gave on-site lectures at art museums, and sites of historical
  and cultural interest.</p>

  <p>Like many astronomers, Ray was well traveled. He had sabbaticals at the
  University of Cambridge in 1980, and at the Dublin Institute of Advanced Study
  (Dunsink Observatory), Ireland, in 1996-97. The latter was funded by his
  winning a Fulbright Fellowship, which enabled him to further his studies of
  the Celtic astronomical traditions. Earlier in 1971-72, Ray served as Program
  Officer for Stars and Stellar Evolution in the Astronomy Section of the
  National Science Foundation.</p>

  <p>Ray was one of the three "originators" of "The Inspiration of Astronomical
  Phenomena" (INSAP) Conferences. These conferences provide scholarly
  discussions on the many and variegated cultural impacts of the perceptions
  about the day- and night-time sky, thus providing a forum for a broad sampling
  of artists, historians, philosophers, and scientists to get together, compare
  notes, and ask questions of one another. The INSAP Conferences have taken
  place near Castel Gandolfo Italy, on the island of Malta, near Palermo Italy,
  and at Oxford University in England.</p>

  <p>Ray's scholarship also was manifest in his activities as editor. For some
  years in the 1990s, he edited two astronomy journals, The Astronomy Quarterly
  and Vistas in Astronomy.</p>

  <p>Raymond E. White, Jr., is survived by his wife Ruby E. (nee Fisk), his high
  school sweetheart at Heidelberg High in Germany. Their children include
  Raymond E. White III (Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of
  Alabama, Tuscaloosa), Kathleen M. (White) Wade, and Kevin D. White. Ray was
  proud of two beautiful granddaughters, Charlotte R. Wade and Sarah E.
  Wade.</p>

  <p>Ray was proud of his early role with Steward Observatory Director Bart Bok
  in the commissioning of the "90-inch" reflector at the University of Arizona
  site on Kitt Peak in 1969. He built the direct camera, and was invited by his
  close friend Bok to share the "first light" of this telescope, now renamed the
  Bok 2.3-m telescope. When Professor Bok passed away, the astronomy magazine
  Sky &amp; Telescope invited Ray to write an article which was entitled "Bart
  J. Bok (1906-83): Personal Memoir from a Grandson." (Bok mentored Ivan R.
  King, who was Ray's thesis advisor.) In his concluding remarks, Ray wrote,
  "The aspect of Bart J. Bok I will miss the most is his exuberance for the art
  of astronomy." We will also miss greatly this aspect of Raymond E. White,
  Jr.</p>
