  <p>David Burstein, longtime galaxy researcher at Arizona State University,
  died on 26 December 2009 at age 62, of Pick's disease, a degenerative
  neurological condition whose symptoms are similar to those of Alzheimer's.
  Born 19 May 1947, Burstein grew up in New Jersey and developed his interest in
  science and mathematics at a young age. Initially, he had planned a career as
  a theoretical mathematician, but changed his mind during his undergraduate
  years at Wesleyan University. He received his bachelor's degree in astronomy
  from Wesleyan in 1969, having completed a senior thesis based on work with Van
  Vleck Observatory’s 24-inch Perkin reflecting telescope. Burstein went on to
  obtain his Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1978. His
  Ph.D. thesis, "The Structure and Metallicity of S0 Galaxies," was supervised
  by Sandy Faber.</p>
  
  <p>In 1982, after post-docs at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, in
  Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Carnegie Institution, in Washington,
  D.C., Burstein joined the astronomy faculty at Arizona State University, in
  Tempe, Arizona, where he taught for the next 26 years. During the 1980s, he
  joined a collaboration of astronomers that became known as the "Seven
  Samurai" (Burstein, Roger Davies, Alan Dressler, Sandra Faber, Donald
  Lynden-Bell, Roberto J. Terlevich, and Gary Wegner), who surveyed the
  distribution and movements of some 400 elliptical galaxies. Their
  controversial findings were announced by Burstein at a meeting of
  astronomers in Hawaii in January 1986. (See Burstein, et al, “Elliptical
  Galaxies and Non-Uniformities in the Hubble Flow,” in <i>Galaxy Distances
  and Deviations from Universal Expansion</i>, ed. B. F. Madore and R. B.
  Tully (Boston: D. Reidel), p. 123.) As memorably captured by science writer
  Dennis Overbye in <i>The New York Times</i> (23 October 1994): “They
  reported that a vast region of space 500 million light-years in diameter,
  containing hundreds of thousands of galaxies, was being drawn sideways, as
  it were, through expanding space, like a raft being pulled downstream at two
  million miles per hour toward some cosmic Niagara, a putative colossal
  concentration of mass later dubbed the Great Attractor.” The history of the
  project is told in Alan Dressler’s book, <i>Voyage To The Great Attractor:
  Exploring Intergalactic Space</i>.</p>

  <p>During his career, David Burstein was author or co-author of well over
  200 articles in journals and conference proceedings, as well as co-author of
  the college textbook <i>21st Century Astronomy</i>. At ASU, he taught
  astronomy to many hundreds of students and served on numerous faculty
  committees, including a year as the president of the Academic Assembly. He
  was an avid fan of the Sun Devils football team. He is survived by his wife
  Gail; his daughter Elizabeth Browne (Eric) of Tucson; his son Jonathan
  Burstein (Kathy), of Delray Beach, FL; his grandson Andrew David Burstein;
  and his father-in-law Edmund T. Kelly, of Tempe.</p>

  <p>In a 5 July 1996 interview with the <i>Hartford Courant</i> newspaper,
  Burstein said, “How many people, when they're young, look up into the sky
  and wonder where it all came from. We are the fortunate few who can answer
  the questions we asked when we're young.”</p>
