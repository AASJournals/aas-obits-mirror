  <p>Dr. Leonid Ozernoy, a well-known astrophysicist trained in the former
  Soviet Union, died on 28 February 2002 after a long illness. Born on 19 May
  1939 in Moscow, Leonid Ozernoy earned degrees in astronomy and physics from
  Moscow University. He received his doctorate in physics and mathematics in
  1971 from the P. N. Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow, where he worked as a
  senior research scientist from 1971-1986. He completed his dissertation under
  the guidance of Dr. Vitaly Ginzburg, one of the most senior Soviet
  astrophysicists. Dr. Ozernoy was a prolific scientist with a broad array of
  interests in fields as diverse as cosmology, active galaxies and quasars,
  black holes, pulsars, and the evolution of the solar system. He made many
  fundamental contributions to these areas as author or coauthor of over 280
  scientific publications, as well as several books. In particular, he performed
  groundbreaking studies of the central black hole in the Galactic nucleus, and
  the astrophysics of magnetoid objects, postulated to exist in the centers of
  active galaxies.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ozernoy began his career in the former Soviet Union during a time of
  great duress for Jewish scientists. Due to his religious heritage, and his
  support of fellow dissident Andrei Sakharov, Soviet authorities blocked him
  from accepting a visiting professorship at Harvard in 1979. As a result of his
  unsuccessful visa request and resulting status as a <em>refusenik</em>, Dr.
  Ozernoy was dismissed from his position as Assistant Professor at Moscow
  Physics &amp; Technology Institute, and was also forbidden from publishing his
  research. Eventually, through the intervention of United States Senator Edward
  M. Kennedy, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev allowed Dr. Ozernoy to
  immigrate with his family to the United States in 1986.</p>

  <p>In the United States, Dr. Ozernoy held positions as a visiting scientist at
  Harvard University, Boston University, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and
  NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center before joining the faculty of George Mason
  University in 1993. He was promoted to full professor of physics and
  computational sciences in 2001. During this period of time, he focused his
  attention mainly on studies of the zodiacal light and the associated problem
  of the computational dynamics of the solar system. He continued an active
  schedule of research and teaching at Mason until shortly before his death, and
  is fondly remembered by his many colleagues, collaborators, and friends.</p>

  <p>Dr. Ozernoy is survived by wife of 33 years, Maryanne Ozernoy, and
  daughters Ilana Ozernoy and Alisa Ozernoy Kuperman.</p>
