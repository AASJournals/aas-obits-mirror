  <p>Jan van Paradijs, who died in Amsterdam on November 2, 1999, was one of the
  world's foremost high-energy astrophysicists. He will probably be best
  remembered for the discovery, on February 28, 1997, of the first optical
  afterglow of a cosmic gamma ray burst (GRB), which established the distant,
  extragalactic nature of these events and solved what had, for some 30 years,
  been a major problem in astrophysics. Thanks to this first optical
  identification, since followed by a dozen others, we now know that the GRBs,
  which last at most a few minutes, can produce an optical afterglow that lasts
  for days to weeks and sometimes even months, that some, at least, occur in
  very distant galaxies, and that they represent an enormous outburst of energy,
  with luminosities exceeding those of Type Ia supernovae, if the emission is
  isotropic. This was only one of his many discoveries in high energy
  astrophysics, which range from the first measurement of a mass of a neutron
  star, the X-ray pulsar Vela X-I (1975) to the proof that X-ray burst sources
  are neutron stars (1978) and are members of binary systems (1980, 1981), and
  the first spatially resolved spectroscopic mapping of an accretion disk
  (1993).</p>

  <p>Van Paradijs was born on June 9, 1946, in Haarlem, The Netherlands, the
  eldest of seven children in a bricklayer's family. Thanks to the intervention
  of the headmaster of his Roman Catholic primary school, his parents sent him
  to a Haarlem HBS, a secondary school that prepares students for higher
  education. In 1963, he started studies in mathematics, physics, and astronomy
  at the University of Amsterdam. He excelled in all three fields, obtained his
  candidate degree in 1966, and graduated in 1970. In these years, Jan also
  excelled in basketball, playing in the top league in his home town,
  Haarlem.</p>

  <p>From 1970 to 1975, van Paradijs carried out PhD research on the structure
  and chemical composition of cool giant stars, under the guidance of Prof.
  David Koelbloed. This included a major discovery in 1972: that what stellar
  spectroscopists call "micro-turbulence" (a mechanism that broadens spectral
  lines and increases their strength) is real hydrodynamical turbulence. He
  found this from the variation of micro-turbulent velocity during the pulsation
  cycle of Cepheid variables. The knowledge of stellar spectroscopy and
  photometry which he acquired during those years, as well as expertise in the
  theory of stellar atmospheres, provided him with a solid basis for his later
  research on X-ray binaries and neutron stars, to which he switched in
  1975.</p>

  <p>This field of study remained a life-long interest, and after his
  appointment in 1988 as a full professor, Jan organized many international
  meetings and summer schools on neutron star physics and X-ray astronomy,
  resulting in seven books, which regularly updated our knowledge in these
  fields.</p>

  <p>From 1977 to 1979, van Paradijs was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, where he
  became interested in X-ray bursts, powerful short-lived bursts of X-rays that
  had been discovered in globular clusters in 1975 by the Dutch ANS satellite.
  From these days dated a close friendship and collaboration with Walter Lewin,
  with whom he published more than 120 of his 400-plus scientific papers.</p>

  <p>Soon Jan became an expert in ground-based observations of the optical
  flashes coming simultaneously with the X-rays from the bursts. His extensive
  experience in this field gave him a head start over others when, in 1996, the
  wide-field, hard X-ray camera of the BeppoSAX satellite began to provide, for
  the first time, prompt, accurate positions for gamma ray bursts. It was,
  therefore, no coincidence that van Paradijs, with his students Paul Groot and
  Titus Galama, was the first to detect the optical afterglow of a GRB and to
  establish its extragalactic nature.</p>

  <p>On top of this came the discovery by Galama and Paul Vreeswijk of the
  peculiar supernova 1998bw, coinciding with the GRB of 25 April 1998. This may
  have been the first observed supernova in which a black hole was formed. It
  has been followed by two more GRB-SN coincidences discovered by Jan's
  collaborators Bloom, Reichart, and Galama.</p>

  <p>In 1992, Jan married Greek astrophysicist-colleague Chryssa Kouveliotou of
  NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and from 1993 he
  held a part-time professorship at the University of Alabama. He was co-author
  on her 1998 paper on the discovery of magnetars (neutron stars with magnetic
  fields of 10<sup>15</sup> Gauss, one hundred times larger than previously
  known) just as she was co-author on his 1997 paper on the first GRB optical
  afterglow. During the last seven months of Jan's life, Chryssa essentially
  suspended her career to care for him, and, in the month before his death, he
  was able to finish an article for <em>Science</em> on the relation between
  GRBs and supernovae, which was published on 22 October 1999.</p>

  <p>Van Paradijs guided the research of more than 15 PhD students in Amsterdam
  and Huntsville. He is survived by a son and a daughter from a previous
  marriage and by three grandchildren. Jan will be remembered as one of the
  greatest high energy astrophysicists of his time and as a fine colleague and
  friend.</p>
