  <p><strong>Thomas Ingerson died on Thursday the 8<sup>th</sup> of August, 2019.</strong></p>

  <p>Tom Ingerson was born on May 30, 1938. He died from Alzheimer’s disease
  on August 8, 2019, at the age of 81. Tom graduated from High School in El
  Paso, Texas, attended the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated
  with a degree in physics in 1960. While in high school he built rockets of
  his own design, and in college Tom worked at the White Sands Missile
  Range.</p>

  <p>He then attended the University of Colorado Boulder and graduated with a
  Ph.D. in Physics in 1965. His dissertation was entitled “Gravitational
  Radiation in a Static Steady-State Cosmology” and he used to joke that he
  was not a “rocket scientist” but a theoretical cosmologist. However, he was
  a rocket scientist too. He was a man with an uncanny mind and wonderful
  personality. He made friends wherever he went, and as a professor at two
  universities and as an Explorer Scout Leader, he managed to guide many
  people throughout his life.</p>

  <p>He was the professor of physics at Western New Mexico University, in
  Silver City, New Mexico, from 1964 until 1968 and formed a Boy Scout
  Explorer Post there that attracted some of the brightest minds that Silver
  City had to offer. His scouts included young men who went on to wonderful
  careers in a variety of fields. His scouts grew up to become physicists,
  magnetic science specialists, engineers, doctors, dentists, optometrists,
  business owners and other professionals. He encouraged people to express
  themselves, to explore, to read and learn, and to behave in an ethical
  manner.</p>

  <p>He left Silver City and moved to Moscow, Idaho, where he taught physics
  at the University of Idaho. While there, he formed another Explorer Post and
  guided another group of young men into adulthood and success. His focus was
  more on travel, camping, learning, and personal growth rather than merit
  badges and advancing through the ranks of boy scouts.</p>

  <p>His interests included: camping, cooking, playing the piano, reading,
  motorcycles, “ham” radios, electronic design and repair, and a huge variety
  of other activities. He could talk about anything but rarely lectured anyone
  except his students. His scouts were trained by experiences and when
  traveling, he would pair scouts off to be in charge of the
  cooking/cleaning/purchasing and laundry for a week at a time. There were
  also expectations that each scout would know a section of the area being
  traveled through and know as much as possible about the roads, the towns,
  the facilities, the activities and the local culture as they could learn.
  Each young man had a day of the week where he was in charge of decisions,
  another day as the navigator, and another day as advisor to the others. That
  did not prevent the rest of the group from wrestling in the back of his
  modified van and generally raising havoc wherever they went.</p>

  <p>His travels with the Silver City troop included trips to Colorado, to the
  Yukon Territory in Canada, to Belize (then British Honduras), and to Panama.
  All those trips were basically camping trips with seven scouts and himself.
  There were also many hiking trips through the Gila National Forest, to the
  Chiracahua National Forest, cave exploring, trips to Kitt Peak National
  Observatory, floating down the Gila River on tubes, and short weekend
  camping trips. On one trip the scouts found themselves on top of Mogollon
  Baldy during a meteor shower and stayed up all night.</p>

  <p>His incredibly active lifestyle continued while he lived in Moscow where
  he again formed an Explorer Post. He was once again in his comfort zone
  being the catalyst that allowed many young people to discover the wonders of
  knowledge and the world. This group ventured twice to Peru, three times to
  Mexico and Central America, and even once to the USSR, which led to some
  national media attention since this occurred in 1971 in the midst of the
  Cold War.</p>

  <p>During a sabbatical leave from the University of Idaho in 1975, he worked
  at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and lived in La Serena,
  Chile. Besides taking on technical challenges for the observatory, he of
  course became involved with the local scouting organization in La Serena,
  and travelled far and wide with them in Chile and Argentina. Following this
  year at CTIO, he took an extensive trip around the world accompanied by one
  of the Explorer Post members from Moscow. Together, they visited many
  Pacific islands and countries in Southeast Asia. Upon arriving in India,
  they travelled overland to England, and even crossed through Afghanistan.
  Here, they walked among camels and donkey carts along the ancient streets of
  Herat, lined with walls possibly thousands of years old, completely unaware
  that it would soon become ruins following the Soviet invasion that occurred
  just a few years later.</p>

  <p>Once Tom tired of teaching, he decided to leave physics and from 1983 to
  2001 he returned to work at CTIO in Chile. It was while he was living in
  Chile that he married his lovely wife and companion, Isabel Echenique
  Ingerson. They had three wonderful daughters: Tonya, Alexia and Zoe. Tom was
  about sixty when he had those girls, and he once said that you can still
  build wonderful things with old tools. He built those girls a castle
  fortress in their front yard and had all types of trees growing in his
  personal arboretum in the back yard. He still loved cooking and playing
  classical pieces on his piano.</p>

  <p>He did freelance work from 2001 through 2006, and that included among
  other things the design of the upgrade to the Brazilian National Telescope
  located in Itajuba, Brazil. He was an electronics and design genius and
  found ways to improve optical telescopes with the use of photon counting
  using photodiodes to improve their sensitivity.</p>

  <p>There is a book by Thomas A. Bass called <em>The Eudaemonic Pie</em>,
  which was published in 1985. This book chronicles the story of some of Tom’s
  former scouts in their design of a computer to assist them in winning at the
  roulette table in Las Vegas. Interviews with Tom are included in this book
  and provide an insight into his view of his own life and that of his
  scouts.</p>

  <p>To be sure, everyone who knew Tom would have some loving or impactful
  memory or story to tell about knowing him. It is not just the world of
  physics and astronomy that has lost a brilliant star, it’s all of us who
  knew and loved him. He used a phrase to say goodbye to people, and so it
  will be used for people to say goodbye to him: Un abrazo a todos (a hug for
  everybody).</p>
