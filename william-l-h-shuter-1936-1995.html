      <h1>William L. H. Shuter (1936-1995)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>William Shuter, professor in the Department of Physics and the first radio
  astronomer hired at the University of British Columbia, died in Vancouver
  after a very brief illness on 19 March 1995.</p>

  <p>Bill was born in South Africa and obtained his BSc and MSc from Rhodes
  University and his PhD from the University of Manchester in 1963 under the
  supervision of R. D. Davies. He was among the first to use the 250 foot Mark I
  radio telescope, then the largest fully steerable telescope in the world.
  After his degree, Bill returned to Rhodes University to teach. He came to UBC
  in 1965 to start a research program in radio astronomy and astrophysics.</p>

  <p>One of his first research programs at UBC was a large-scale survey of HI
  emission from the Galaxy carried out at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical
  Observatory (DRAO) in Penticton, which was the first contact between DRAO and
  UBC physics. Some of our students continue to do research there.</p>

  <p>In the early 1970s, Bill installed a 15-foot antenna at UBC. Various
  projects including observations of CO emission at 2.6 mm were carried out.
  This began Canadian involvement in short wavelength radio astronomy which
  continues at submillimeter wavelengths with the Canadian partnership in the
  James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. He had wide interests in
  instrumentation; most recently he was working with a group on a design for
  liquid mirror telescopes which could observe away from the zenith, which
  resulted in one of his last publications.</p>

  <p>Bill was a member of numerous professional societies in astronomy, and gave
  service to the astronomical community with memberships on the initial Council
  of the Canadian Astronomical Society, the NRC Associate Committee for
  Astronomy, the Canadian National Committee for the IAU, and was chairman of
  Canadian Commission V of URSI.</p>

  <p>Bill was a dedicated teacher who found great enjoyment in the undergraduate
  engineering physics project labs, taking a hand in developing some of them. He
  worked with engineering physics students to develop Fresnel antennae for
  receiving transmissions from satellites, and was a consultant to the
  Provincial Government on satellite TV systems. Bill is survived by his wife
  Beverley, and two sons, William and Edward. He will be missed by all who knew
  him.</p>
