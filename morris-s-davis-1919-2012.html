      <h1>Morris S. Davis (1919-2012)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Morris Schuyler Davis, 92, Morehead Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at the
  University of North Carolina and early proponent of the use of computers in
  astronomical research, died on 19 June 2012 in Chapel Hill. Davis was born on
  14 December 1919 in Brooklyn, New York, to Helen and Nathan Davis, an
  immigrant who ran a necktie manufacturing business. During his teenage years,
  he became fascinated by the stars and joined the Hayden Planetarium's Young
  Astronomers' Club. A lifelong pacifist, he was a conscientious objector during
  World War II, for which he served a year at the Danbury (Connecticut) Federal
  Correctional Institution. In 1945, while employed at a Quaker Settlement house
  in Philadelphia, he married Dorothy Hall, who would later become a well-known
  potter in North Carolina.</p>

  <p>Davis completed his Ph.D. in the field of celestial mechanics at Yale
  University in 1950 under the supervision of Dirk Brouwer. His thesis, “A Study
  of the Method of Rectangular Coordinates in General Planetary Theory,” was
  published in the <i>Astronomical Journal</i> in February 1952. Davis taught
  general astronomy to undergraduates and celestial mechanics to graduate
  students at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill from 1952 to 1956 and
  from 1970 to 1985. His early-career experience with computers led to his
  appointment as Director of the Yale University Computation Center from
  1956-1966.</p>

  <p>In his memoir, <i>Adventures in Order and Chaos</i>, astronomer George
  Contopoulos recalls how Morris Davis reach out to him during a lonely summer
  sabbatical at Yale:</p>

  <p>“Morris Davis provided something like a family for me. … [He] invited me to
  his house once a week. He had five nice children. Everyone was playing a
  musical instrument. And when they sang they were excellent. In return I told
  them fairy tales. Thus, we became good friends, and I learn of their progress
  every Christmas even now.</p>

  <p>I owe to Morris Davis also a lot as regards the use of computers. We had,
  first, a small computer, connected with a [tele-]typewriter. When I wanted to
  calculate an orbit, I was sitting next to the typewriter with a piece of graph
  paper. Every few minutes the typewriter would write the coordinates of a point
  along the orbit. I would mark the point on the paper and then wait for the
  next line. This process was incredibly slow. But even if I had all the
  computer results in front of me, the drawing of each orbit took several (3-5)
  hours.”</p>

  <p>Morris Davis returned to North Carolina in 1966 as Director of the Triangle
  Universities Computation Center, in Research Triangle Park, a post he held
  until 1970. During this period, he developed a multi-campus network of
  computers and served as a Research Associate in Astronomy at the University of
  North Carolina, North Carolina State, and Duke University.</p>

  <p>Davis resumed his full-time faculty status at UNC from 1970-1985. At
  various times, he held teaching positions at the University of Missouri and
  University of Kentucky and was a board member of the National Accelerator
  Laboratory (Fermilab) and the Hubble Space Telescope. He was also Editor in
  Chief of the journal <i>Celestial Mechanics</i> from 1985 to 1989. Davis
  enjoyed lecturing to community groups about astronomy and wrote a regular
  astronomy column in the <i>Chapel Hill Weekly</i> (now <i>Chapel Hill
  News</i>) for several years.</p>
