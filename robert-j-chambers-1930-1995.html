      <h1>Robert J. Chambers (1930-1995)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Robert Chambers, Director of Brackett Observatory and professor of
  astronomy at Pomona College, was born on 23 September 1930. After graduating
  from the University of Washington in mechanical engineering, he served in the
  U.S. Air Force during the Korean War before entering graduate work in
  astronomy at Berkeley, where he received his PhD in 1964.</p>

  <p>Bob joined the Pomona College faculty in 1963 where astronomy had been
  taught since the College's founding in 1887. In his thirty years at Pomona,
  about one-third of the College students took his perennially popular course
  for nonscience majors, Introduction to Astronomy. He was a valued mentor to
  upper-division astronomy and physics students, several of whom became
  professional astronomers. His down-to-earth good humor and bemused tolerance
  of lengthy mathematical proofs enlivened lecture topics from planetary
  surfaces to rigid-body rotation. In recognition of his contributions, Bob was
  twice awarded the Wig Distinguished Teaching Award.</p>

  <p>From 1968 to 1973, Bob served as Academic Director for the summer science
  program in astronomy held at the Thacher School in Ojai, CA. During each
  summer, he introduced 36 highly-motivated high-school seniors to the wonders
  and mysteries of astronomy, from observing to Laplacian orbit reduction. Many
  of those students describe the Thacher SSP as one of the most influential
  educational experiences of their lives, and several have become
  astronomers.</p>

  <p>Bob worked tirelessly to improve the observational facilities and
  instrumentation at Pomona. In 1976, with the assistance of the Harry G. Steele
  Foundation, he augmented the college's observatory with a 22-inch Cassegrain.
  His real dream, though, was a research-grade instrument at a dark site well
  away from the light pollution of Los Angeles County. That dream was realized
  in 1990, with "first light" in a 1-meter reflector located at the Table
  Mountain Observatory in the San Gabriel Mountains.</p>

  <p>After retiring, Bob returned to an earlier love, optical instrument design,
  working as an engineering specialist at the Aerospace Corporation in El
  Segundo. He maintained his interest in Table Mountain Observatory, and led
  several eclipse cruises and field trips for Pomona College alumni, including
  the very well-attended 1991 Baja California eclipse. He died of cancer on 18
  June 1995. His was a voice of moderation and common sense in the physics
  department and Pomona College as a whole, and he is greatly missed by his
  colleagues and former students.</p>
