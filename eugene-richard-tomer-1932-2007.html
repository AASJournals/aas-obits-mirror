      <h1>Eugene Richard Tomer (1932-2007)</h1>

      
<div>
  <p>Dr. Eugene R. Tomer passed away on 2 July 2007 at his home in San
  Francisco, California. The cause of death was cancer. Tomer was a consulting
  applied mathematician with a wide range of interests in dynamical astronomy,
  electromagnetic theory for use in communications, and computational methods of
  applied mathematics. He was a member of AAS, and the Society for Applied and
  Industrial Mathematics [SIAM]. With K. H. Prendergast, he co-wrote the
  influential paper "Self-consistent Models of Elliptical Galaxies," published
  in the Astronomical Journal 75 (1970), 674-679. This paper has been cited over
  eighty times.</p>

  <p>Tomer was born on 13 June 1932. He earned the Ph.D. in Mathematics at the
  University of California-Berkeley in 1978 (title of dissertation: On the
  C*-algebra of the Hermite Operator). In 1996 he and A. F. Peterson wrote
  "Meeting the Challenges Presented by Computational Electromagnetics," a
  publication of the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, California.</p>

  <p>This writer met Eugene at the 1992 Annual SIAM meeting in Los Angeles in
  connection with the Activity Group on Orthogonal Polynomials and Special
  Functions, which the writer chaired at the time. Eugene volunteered to edit
  the Newsletter of the group, which he did from July 1992 to July 1995. Thanks
  to his skills and efforts, the Newsletter became a carefully edited,
  professional publication. Eugene not only organized a Problems Column,
  attracting questions in pure and applied mathematics, but he also designed the
  logo for the group. He gave much time and effort to this service, in an era
  when copy had to be physically assembled and mailed to SIAM Headquarters.
  Eventually he felt he had done what he could for the Activity Group. He told
  me that he hoped the Group would get seriously involved with applications such
  as in astronomy, physics, and sciences that use special function solutions of
  differential equations.</p>

  <p>During Tomer's editorship, we communicated mostly by e-mail, our homes
  being far apart. He was a good friend to the Group and to me, as much as one
  can be over a separation of thousands of miles. As well, Eugene was an active
  amateur radio operator, much appreciated by his local amateur radio community,
  with call sign WI6X. He left behind family, friends, and one son.</p>
